1. Make sure you have the OSDK installed, if not download it from http://osdk.defence-force.org and install it
2. Run osdk_makedata.bat, this will convert the content of the Graphics folder as oric compatible data
3. Run osdk_build.bat, this will build the project, creating a BUILD folder containing the DSK file
4. Run osdk_execute.bat, this will launch an emulator and automatically run the DSK image file
5. Profit !

Enjoy :)
