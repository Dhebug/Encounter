
Here is a code sample often use in my C source:


unsigned char	FlagDoorOpen=TRUE;

    if (FlagDoorOpen)
    {
	....
	....
	....
    }



Here is the PCode equivalent after compilation with RCC16:

	CZBW_DD(_FlagDoorOpen,tmp0)
	EQ0W_D(tmp0,Lmain125)



Here is the compiled code in full optimisation mode:

	lda _FlagDoorOpen ;
	sta tmp0 ;		! All these instructions
	lda #0 ;		! are useless...
	sta tmp0+1 ;		!
	lda tmp0 ;		!
	ora tmp0+1 ;		!
	bne *+5 ;
	jmp Lmain378 ;



Here is the equivalent code:

	lda _FlagDoorOpen;
	bne *+5:
	jmp Lmain378



I think, I will rewrite all my code in 6502 myself !
