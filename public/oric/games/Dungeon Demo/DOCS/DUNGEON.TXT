the 'sprites' must be 5 bytes width, and 22 lines height,
colors attributs included !

That's all...


Hello folks, and thank you for having downloaded this preview of my great
(?) adventure game.


Who am I ???
- I'm a ex-Oric,ex-Atari ST/Falcon coder. For those who knows a little bit
about the Atari Demo-Scene, I'm the Co-Foundater of a demo group called
® NEXT ¯ in France. We have done some work as ® The charts ¯, ® The
Official 1991 Charts compilation ¯, and ® The Phaleon Demo ¯. My pseudonym
was ® Dbug ¯.
Now, I'm working in a french game company called Adeline Software. I've
worked on Time Commando (PlayStation version).



Historic:
- I've bought an Oric ATMOS computer (after learning on ZX80) in the 198x and
really learn to program with it. At this period, I didn't know many people
using Oric computers in my town, so I've to do my own programs... And I've
started a adventure Game, but I've to stop because I reached the infamous
'Not enough memory' message... I've made another game, an arcade game called
'Panic Miner Maze', but nobody had seen it except my mother, my sister and a
couple of friend !




And now, here is the preview of this game, totaly rewritten in C. I know for
the moment it is not looking really great, but it represent only one week of
work, consisting mainly in creating some usefull tools like a PCX picture
converter (graphix were done by DeluxePaint) using foreground attributs, trying
to make the whole C development kit working, and so on.

The total size of the code+graphics is now about 30 kbyte. I hope it will works
fine. I'm running low of memory, but I've some remaining tricks ! All the display
is now done in 6502 assembly language.


The commands:

- Up		Move forward
- Down		Move backward
- Left		Rotate left 90ø
- Right 	Rotate right 90ø

- Space Bar	Open the doors/Action buttons

- CTRL Left	Move left
- CTRL Right	Move right
- CTRL Down	Rotate 180ø

- 1/2/3/4	Select the leader
- CTRL 1	Swap Leader with 1st Hero
- CTRL 2	Swap Leader with 2nd Hero
- CTRL 3	Swap Leader with 3rd Hero
- CTRL 4	Swap Leader with 4th Hero



For the moment you can't do anything in the dungeon. The items have no utility.

The only things interresting in this demo, is to give you a forseeing of what
it could be if I'm motivated...

The future:
- Sedoric load/save features (I don't know how Sedoric works...)
- Great sounds and music (hum...)
- Total realistic gestion of Objects/LifePoint/Magic/etc...
- Some hungry monsters
- Some tresures to collect
- Some powerful weapons/armours
- And a very evil magician to find and destroy (original no ???)

- PC Pentium 75
- Diamond Stealth 64 PCI
- Monitor Iiyama Vision Master 17" (a television is better for Oric display...)
