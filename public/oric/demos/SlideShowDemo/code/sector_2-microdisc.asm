;
; This part of the code is a bit tricky: Basically the Atmos with Microdisc and the Telestrat despite using a similar boot 
; loading system are actually loading the boot sector at different addresses.
;
; Since the 6502 is not particularly well equiped to handle code that can be loaded at any address we had to find a trick.
; What we are doing is to make the code run at a particular address, and have a small module that makes sure that it is
; moved at the correct place wherever it was loaded in first place. That makes the code a lot easier to write :)
;
; Warning: This whole code CANNOT be more than 256 bytes (ie: the size of the sector)
;
; The bootloader will be placed in the screen area because we know that this is not going to be used by the operating system.
; By chosing an address in HIRES area, we also guarantee that it will not be visible on the screen (the Oric boots in TEXT).

; Type I commands
; 	The type I commands include the Restore, Seek, Step, Step-In and Step-
; 	Out commands. Each of the Type I commands contains a rate field r1 r0
; 	which determines the stepping motor rate.
; 		r1 r0 Stepping rate
; 		 0  0    6 ms
; 		 0  1   12 ms
; 		 1  0   20 ms
; 		 1  1   30 ms
; 	An optional verification of head position can be performed by settling
; 	bit 2 (V=1) in the command word. The track number from the first
; 	encountered ID Field is compared against the contents of the Track
; 	Register. If the track numbers compare (and the ID Field CRC is correct)
; 	the verify operation is complete and an INTRQ is generated with no
; 	errors. 
; 	
; Seek
; 	This command assumes that the Track Register contains the track number
; 	of the current position of the head and the Data Register contains the
; 	desired track number. The FD179X will update the Track Register and
; 	issue stepping pulses in the appropriate direction until the contents of
; 	the Track Register are equal to the contents of the Data Register. An
; 	interrupt is generated at the completion of the command. Note: when
; 	using multiple drives, the track register must be updated for the drive
; 	selected before seeks are issued.

; 
; Type II commands
; 	Type II commands are the Read Sector and Write Sector commands. Prior
; 	to loading the Type II command into the Command Register, the computer
; 	must load the Sector Register with the desired sector number. Upon
; 	receipt of the Type II command, the busy status bit is set. The FD179X
; 	must find an ID field with a matching Track number and Sector number,
; 	otherwise the Record not found status bit is set and the command is
; 	terminated with an interrupt. Each of the Type II commands contains an
; 	m flag which determines if multiple records (sectors) are to be read or
; 	written. If m=0, a single sector is read or written and an interrupt is
; 	generated at the completion of the command. If m=1, multiple records are
; 	read or written with the sector register internally updated so that an
; 	address verification can occur on the next record. The FD179X will
; 	continue to read or write multiple records and update the sector
; 	register in numerical ascending sequence until the sector register
; 	exceeds the number of sectors on the track or until the Force Interrupt
; 	command is loaded into the Command Register. The Type II commands for
; 	1791-94 also contain side select compare flags. When C=0 (bit 1), no
; 	comparison is made. When C=1, the LSB of the side number is read off the
; 	ID Field of the disk and compared with the contents of the S flag.
; 
; Read Sector
; 	Upon receipt of the command, the head is loaded, the busy status bit set
; 	and when an ID field is encountered that has the correct track number,
; 	correct sector number, correct side number, and correct CRC, the data
; 	field is presented to the computer. An DRQ is generated each time a byte
; 	is transferred to the DR. At the end of the Read operation, the type of
; 	Data Address Mark encountered in the data field is recorded in the
; 	Status Register (bit 5).

During a command which performs a data transfer such as diskette
read or write, data must be read from or written to the diskettes
byte-byâ€”byte via the Z-80A. This can be done either by polling
the WD1793 data request bit (DRQ, status bit 1) or by the DRQ
interrupt. Reading or writing the data register will reset both
the DRQ bit and interrupt. The total time between byte transfers
is 23 microseconds for 5" double density or 8" single density;
the polling loop or interrupt service routine must be shorter
than this to insure that no bytes are lost.

The diskette motors are turned on by resetting bit 6 of port A of
the miscellaneous 8255, and turned off by setting the same bit.
Our BIOS code turns the motors on, then leaves them on for two
seconds to save time in the case of multiple disk accesses.
After turning on the motors, you must wait 800 ms. to be sure
that the drives are up to speed before attempting to transfer
data. The Ready input of the WD1793 is supplied from pin 34 of
the drive interface; it indicates that the drive is loaded and
has made at least one revolution at > 50% of normal speed. Note
that the drive looks at the index pulse for this; if a hard-
sectored disk is inserted the results are invalid.

The reset line of the WD1793 is held in the reset mode by
hardware at power-on. A timing restriction is inherent in the
WD1793: after writing a command, the Z-80A must not read the
status register for 28 microseconds.
