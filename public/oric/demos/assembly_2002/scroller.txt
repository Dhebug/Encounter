Damn! Helsinki - Hartwall Areena - 1.-4. August. That Thing You Used To Do -- get back to it!  - www.assembly.org -           -           Deck on the keys. Ha! Massive f*cking respect to Jmagic, Jugi, Heatbeat and Britelite/Dekadence, Shape&THG/DCS and H7/TRSI for making this intro possible. Schedule was tight but you just gotta be bloody awed seeing how these dudes pulled it off - especially Jmagic and Jugi. You guys, beer will not be running out for you this Boozembly.           -           People often ask me why do I keep myself bothered with these scene things.. It's because where I am I am mostly because of the scene. Things I've learned. Things I've seen. Things I've experienced. Every time I'm organizing something I'm listening to old modules from back in the day, watching - or atleast remembering - old demos. Stuff like that. And yea, I DO have a life you know if that's what you're thinking ;)  Jester/Sanity said it in one of his great modules; So if it all ends tomorrow, I've seen it what's it like -- And I've had a good ride.              -               A hand out to these people.. In NO order! Over the years, you've maked it all worthwhile.

If you ever get around Finland, feel welcomed to drop in, any time.               -               About Assembly.. If we get 1 out of 100 gamers to even think about doing something for the scene.. Then we're there. We've reached our goal. -- Deck/Scoopex//Assembly Org signing off - Res-f*cking-pect for all of you sceners out there, oldskool or not. Keep doing your stuff and other people will follow you.            It's Abyss // AsmOrg & FC hitting the keyboard now. Man, it's been like years since     I last wrote scrollers for Future Crew prods, so this does feel like trip back in       time! A lot has changed since - the people have come and gone, the scene has changed    and grown, controversy and diverse opinions abound. Still something has stayed true     and unchanging for me. The commitment to the scene is the driving force behind  ASSEMBLY. Sure, it's big, filled with gamers, commercial and bad for your mental        health, but still it manages to attract the movers and shakers of the demo scene.       Judge us by the releases made at ASSEMBLY. Some of the most legendary demos have        been released here - from Unreal and Second Reality to Spot and Lapsuus.            --          We have the total party package for you this year. Legends like Rob Hubbard and         Lone Starr, seminars with outstanding speakers, tough compos with more than     40 000 euros in prizes, a great oldskool party area complete with free coffee   and sofas, a monster of a concert with the likes of Machinae Supremacy and CNCD -   so come and prove that the scene is alive!          --              Utmost respect to Deck for putting the wheels in motion and getting this invtro done!   A big hand to the dudes: Jmagic, Jugi, Heatbeat and Britelite/Dekadence,        Shape&THG/DCS and H7/TRSI for getting the invtro done in a record time!                 My deepest thanks to all of the 200 volunteers making ASSEMBLY possible!
