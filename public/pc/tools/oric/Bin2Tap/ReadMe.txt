This code is covered by the "What ever you damn well like" licence.
Use it, abuse it, credit me if you feel like it.

Converts a binary file into an oric tape, either as a .tap or a .wav.  It can also play the binary directly over speaker.

The binary input must have the first two bytes containing the org address.  This is the only constraint.

This README will be improved at a later date ;)
