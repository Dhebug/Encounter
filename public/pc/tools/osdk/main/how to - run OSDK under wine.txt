Tested in Ubuntu Diaper Drake 6.06 LTS with Wine 0.9.23

* Installing the OSDK in Wine:
You need to unzip the archive in the emulated windows drive.
If we want to get it in C:/osdk, then you need to unzip in;
~/.wine/.dosdevices/c


* Setting the environment variable.
Just run regedit from Wine.
You can do that by opening a terminal, and then type:

  wine regedit

at this point you need to create (if it does not yet exist) a new key

 HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Environment

and there you create a new string:

 Name: OSDK
 Value: C:\OSDK


* Running OSDK

Just run the following command:

  wine cmd

then c:
cd OSDK
etc...
you can try compiling a sample by going in 
 
  cd C:\osdk\sample\hello_world_simple
  osdk_build.bat
