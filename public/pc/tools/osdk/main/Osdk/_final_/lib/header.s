/*
Preserving Registers Across Procedure Invocation of
swap
The VAX has a pair of instructions that preserve registers calls and ret. This
example shows how they work.
The VAX C compiler uses a form of callee convention. Examining the code
above, we see that the values in registers r0, r1, r2, and r3 must be saved so
that they can later be restored. The calls instruction expects a 16-bit mask at
the beginning of the procedure to determine which registers are saved: if bit i
is set in the mask, then register i is saved on the stack by the calls instruction.
In addition, calls saves this mask on the stack to allow the return instruction
(ret) to restore the proper registers. Thus the calls executed by the caller
does the saving, but the callee sets the call mask to indicate what should be
saved.
One of the operands for calls gives the number of parameters being
passed, so that calls can adjust the pointers associated with the stack: the argument
pointer (ap), frame pointer (fp), and stack pointer (sp). Of course,
calls also saves the program counter so that the procedure can return!
Thus, to preserve these four registers for swap, we just add the mask at the
beginning of the procedure, letting the calls instruction in the caller do all the
work:
.word ^m<r0,r1,r2,r3>; set bits in mask for 0,1,2,3
This directive tells the assembler to place a 16-bit constant with the proper bits
set to save registers r0 though r3.

/*	
The return instruction undoes the work of calls. When finished, ret sets
the stack pointer from the current frame pointer to pop everything calls
placed on the stack. Along the way, it restores the register values saved by
calls, including those marked by the mask and old values of the fp, ap, and
pc.
To complete the procedure swap, we just add one instruction:
ret ; restore registers and return
