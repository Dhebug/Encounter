	<dt><b>6502</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>8 bit processor created by the Western Digital Center. It can be found into the Oric computers,
	but was also present in various versions in the Acord BBC, Commodore VIC 20 and C64, Atari 8 bits,
	Apple 2 computers, and Nec PC Engine. A 16bit version, called 65816 was also created, and is present
	in the Super Nintendo.

	<dt><b>DOSBox</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>DOSBox is an open source project that makes it possible to run old DOS applications on otherwise non compatible operating systems.
	Using DOSBox it is possible to run a program like Euphoric that has a very strong dependency with a particular system, on a system like
	recent versions of Windows, Linux or MacOS.
	<br>
	<i>See also: <A href="http://dosbox.sourceforge.net">DOSBox official website</A></i>
	<br>
	<br>
	</dd>

	<dt><b>Euphoric</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>The oldest Oric emulator, still developped but getting harder to use on new hardware and software without clutches like DosBox.

	<br>

	<dt><b>Emulator</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>An application able to replicate programmatically the behavior of some hardware. Used for simulation of hardware devices during the design phase, in our case allows us to simulate an Oric machine on a PC.
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>
	</dd>
	
	<dt><b>Microtan 65</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>The ancestor of the Oric. Advanced versions had an hexadecimal keypad to enter commands, and very few
	memory.
	<br>
	<br>
	</dd>

	<dt><b>Mnemonic</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>In order to be easy to remember, each instruction of the processor is identified by a short symbolic
	name that describe what the instruction is doing. For example, <b>TYA</b> means <b>T</b>ransfert the <b>Y</b>
	register content in the <b>A</b> register.
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>
	</dd>

	<dt><b>Opcode</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>Each instruction known from the microprocessor is identified by a particular number: The "operand code"
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>
	</dd>

	<dt><b>Oricutron</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>The most recent Oric emulator. Developped from scratch in C and using SDL it has been ported to numerous platforms from PC to Amiga, from Linux to Android
	<br>

	<dt><b>Pravetz 8D</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>Pravez is a Bulgarian company which made clones of western computers in the eighties. The Pravetz 8D is a clone of the Oric Atmos.
	<br>
	<br>
	</dd>
		
	<dt><b>Preprocessor</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>Tool that can manage simple text replacement task in order to transform a text file in something usable by 
	another tool (compiler, assembler, ...)
	<br>
	<br>
	</dd>

	<dt><b>Telestrat</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>The Telestrat is the last model of the Oric family. It provide a serial interface, two joystick port, and
	integrated floppy disc controlleur, ROM cartridges slots, a second VIA and banked memory.
	<br>
	<br>
	</dd>

	<dt><b>Versatile Interface Adapter (VIA)</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>A dedicated chip designed to complete 6502 based system, that provided advanted input and output capabilities,
	timers, and interrupt driving. On the Oric, it is responsible for handling the sound processor and printer port.
	<br>
	<br>
	</dd>

	<dt><b>Western Digital Center</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>WDC is the company that designed the 6502 processor.
	<br>
	<br>
	</dd>

	<dt><b>Wine</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>Wine is an open source project that makes it possible to run windows applications on Linux.
	Use Wine it is possible to run the OSDK on Linux despite the fact that the OSDK is a Windows based set of programs.
	<br>

	<dt><b>Z80</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>The main challenger of the 6502, this processor was produced by Zilog.
	<br>
	<br>
