
This "OsdkSampleProject" is a simple example that contains almost nothing,
but that can be used as a starting base for developing new projects. 
You just have to copy it somewhere, rename the "OsdkSampleProject" references
you will find in the .DSP file, and voila !

Note: Do not try to edit the DSP with VisualStudio ;)
