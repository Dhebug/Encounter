Usage: md5sum.exe [OPTION] [FILE]...
  or:  md5sum.exe [OPTION] --check [FILE]
Print or check MD5 checksums.
With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

  -b, --binary            read files in binary mode
  -c, --check             check MD5 sums against given list

The following two options are useful only when verifying checksums:
      --status            don't output anything, status code shows success
  -w, --warn              warn about improperly formated MD5 checksum lines

      --help              display this help and exit
      --version           output version information and exit

The sums are computed as described in RFC 1321.  When checking, the input
should be a former output of this program.  The default mode is to print
a line with checksum, a character indicating type (`*' for binary, ` ' for
text), and name for each FILE.

WARNING:  You are using a specially adapted copy of md5sum.  This version
          has been modified as follows:
          1) Only ever use binary mode
          2) Be more liberal about line endings in files used by --check
          3) Built-in Win32 file wildcard matching (globbing)
          This version was compiled by bruce@gridpoint.com for the
          People for a Clearer Phish.  Source code changes are available
          from Bruce upon request.
