To use it:

PictConv options source_name destination_name

options can be:
(I only put the one that are already working)

-f0 => output a MONOCHROME picture
-f1 => output a COLORED picture
-f2 => output a RGB picture
-f3 => output a RB picture

-d0 => No dithering (0/1)
-d1 => Alternate dithering  (0/0.5/1)
-d2 => Ordered dithering (4x4 matrix, 8 levels)
-d3 => Riemersma dithering (based on hilbert curves)

-o0 => Tape format, including a BASIC loader
-o1 => Tape format, simply the picture
-o2 => RAW format. No header.
-o3 => C source code
-o4 => S source code
-o5 => Output a PC picture format
-o6 => 2 bytes (dx,dy) size followed by RAW picture

-t0 => test mode deactivated
-t1 => test mode activated


Have fun.


Frequently Asked Questions:
---------------------------
Q: In colored mode, free size pictures are not accepted. Why ???
A: Try to imagine how you could scroll horizontaly a picture containing
   attributes changes without having huge color changes. This is not possible.
   Free vertical size is allowed anyway, but it's bugged right now :))

Q: In colored mode, the converted picture contains some lines that are black and
   white.
A: These scanlines cannot be converted. A colored pictures should use Oric constraints,
   be in at most 8 colors, no more than 2 colors per 6 pixel bloc, and so on...

Q: In colored mode, PictConv decided to use strange paper and ink changes.
A: Actually PictConv simply tries all the possible combinations of paper, ink,
   video inverse changes that could work to convert the picture. When it find
   one working combination, it moves to the next scanline.


Historic:
---------
0.008
 - Not finished version that try to supported inversed dithering patterns.

0.007
 - Removed the timer check in the colored conversion mode. It was producing bad 
   conversion on slow computers. Anyway, if you are unlucky, a conversion could
   now take hours to perform if the tool has to perform ALL possible combinations.

0.006
 - A message is given if the picture is not found or invalid.
 - Colored mode had some bugs: all now corrected ???

0.005
 - Debugged the -o6 format.
 - Debugged the -f1 mode.

0.004
 - Allow free size pictures (bigger than screen size except for colored mode)

0.003
 - Riemersman dithering implemented 

0.002
 - New version with basic dithering

0.001
 - First beta release
						


To do:
------
- Allow the possibility to choose the label name when using -o3 and -o4 modes. 
- Allow the possibility to choose to "append" the new bitmap to an existing one.
