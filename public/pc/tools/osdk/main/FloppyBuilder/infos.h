Change history for the FloppyBuilder

0.2 - Makedisk (c) 2002 Jérome Debrune, used on all Defence Force demos until 2013
0.3 - 2013/11/24
- Work started in 2013 by Mickaël Pointier for the Oric 30th birthday

0.5 - 2013/12/12
- Fixed parsing of comments
- added a 'OutputFloppyFile' command
- validated that the number of sectors and tracks is correct in the 'SetPosition' command.
- removed some unused variables
- cleaned the offset/track/sector management code
- the 'SetBootSector' command is now 'WriteSector' and automatically move to the next sector after writing data

0.6 - 2013/12/14
- Added the 'LoadDiskTemplate' and 'DefineDisk' commands (and removed these parameters from the command line)
- Added the 'AddTapFile' command, similar to 'AddFile' but automatically removes the header and extract the start address of the file

0.7 - 2013/12/14
- The code now automatically compute the gaps values based on the floppy structure parameters
- The 'DefineDisk' command now works (at least for 2 sided, 42 tracks and 17 sectors floppies)

0.8 - 2013/12/15
- Cleaned up a bit the output description generation

0.9 - 2013/12/15
- Added the 'SetCompressionMode' command. Possible parameters are 'None' (default value) and 'FilePack'

0.10 - 2013/12/17
- The compression code now generates correct data (it was using the Atari ST mode encoding, making the unpacking code not happy)
- Added to the report file the occupation ratio of the floppy (by maintaining an internal list of used sectors also used to check if there's no overlap)

0.11 - 2013/12/19
- Added support for metadata that can be used later on by the programmer

0.12 - 2013/12/27
- The 'DefineDisk' command accepts a variable set of track definition values

0.13 - 2014/01/08
- Added a new parameter to make it possible to bootstrap the floppy building process: With 'init' a description fill be generated even if data is missing,
this makes it possible to do a multi-pass build process which will not fail because it depends on things not yet generated :)

0.14 - 2014/01/08
- The MetaData tables will now not contain any information after the last file that declared metadata, this allows to not waste room in the loader for dummy data

0.15 - 2014/01/08
- The output file now clearly states how much free room is available in bytes on the disk

0.16 - 2014/04/06
- Added a mode where data can be extracted from an existing DSK file
- The parser now accepts quoted strings

0.17 - 2015/05/29
- A macro expansion now accept the new value {FileSize} which gets expanded to the size of the previous file inserted in the script

0.18 - 2015/08/15
- Added a 'ReserveSectors' command that can be used to leave room on the disk for save games or stuff like that.

0.19 - 2016/01/10
- Improved some error message to make them more useful when a problem happens.
- Made it possible to use the system without having to delete the build folder if for some reason the size of a sector file got too large.

1.0 - 2016/01/25
- Added a 'FormatVersion' command to help handle the lack of backward compatibility
- Added a 'WriteLoader' command to simplify the handling of loader specific parameters (the loader cannot be compressed, should not be in the directories, etc...)
- Three new defines are automatically created: FLOPPY_LOADER_TRACK, FLOPPY_LOADER_SECTOR and FLOPPY_LOADER_ADDRESS. They are designed to be used by the boot sectors to help load the loader.
- Added a new set of macro variables: {FileTrack}, {FileSector}, {FileSize} and {FileSizeCompressed}
- It is now possible to use the -D switch on the command line parameters to add a number of defines to the list of defines exported to the header file.

1.1 - 2016/10/30
- Added support for sector interleave: The 'DefineDisk' now has a additional parameter which indicates how far the next sector is (defaults to 1 for a linear search)

1.2 - 2017/12/09
- Hopefully the CRC of floppies should now be correct (thanks ISS and  ThomH)
- Gap2 value changed from 0x22 to 0x4E

1.3 - 2023/01/15
- Forced the current working directory to match the location of the description file so relative paths location can be predicted and stable
- Made a change to the FormatVersion parsing, version 0.x are now rejected with a proper error message instead of "AddFile does not have a size anymore"
- Added the 'AllowImpossibleFloppies' command to accept floppies with 256 tracks (about 2 megabytes of data)
