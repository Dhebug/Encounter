List of modifications:

Change history for the Linker

0.00:
- Originaly created by Vagelis Blathras

0.56 
- Handling of lines that have more than 180 characters

0.57
- Added '-B' option to suppress inclusion of HEADER and TAIL

0.58 - January 2004
- Added filtering of all '#' directives
- Added an icon to the executable file to make it more 'OSDK' integrated :)
- Added '-F' option to enable #file directive (requires modified XA assembler)
- Modified the handling of comments to avoid crashes on C and C++ comments

0.59 - June the 4th 2006
- Corrected a bug that made it impossible to 'link' only one source file

0.63 - 2009-02-14
Fixed a number of issues in the linker:
- (WIP) The old linked filtered out comments, need to implement this feature as well
- removed some test code
- fixed the loading of symbols from the library index  file
- Fixed a problem of text file parsings. Mixed unix/dos cariage return would result in very long lines (containing many lines), leading to some crashes later on.
- Also fixed a problem in reporting the parsed files.

0.64 - 2016/01/17
- Fixed the age old problem if includes from assembler sources leading to Unresolved External errors
