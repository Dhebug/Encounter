Euphoric is giftware, freely distributable. However, it's copyrighted and nobody
is allowed to make profit with it. If you paid for it, you should have only
paid for the medium, there are better ways to spend your money, eg. sending it

Ok, you want to try the emulator now ? Start "euphoric" then load a program with
the Basic command :

CLOAD "DEFENDER"

...(two hours later), press F10 to exit and go on reading this documentation,
it is not that long, you will use the emulator in a better way, and so I have
written it for someone.

1. Installation
---------------

	I suggest you set the ORIC environment variable. This way you will be
	able to run euphoric from any directory, without thinking about dupli-
	cation of the rom file and keyboard map. Then you will easily sort your
	oric programs in different directories. The ORIC variable gives the path
	where the emulator looks for Oric.ROM (Linux users, please take care to
	upper and lowercase), OricDisk.ROM, Jasmin.ROM and Bank1-7 (telestrat
	roms).
	If you don't use the ORIC variable, it will look for Oric.ROM
	in the current directory. The variable gives also the path to the
	Keyboard.def file, if it is not found there, the emulator will use the
	default US mapping (like on the real oric).
	E.g. under dos :

		C> set oric=c:\euphoric\

	under linux with csh (or tcsh, or...) :

		% setenv ORIC /usr/local/euphoric/

	under linux with bsh, ksh,... :
	
		% ORIC=/usr/local/euphoric/
		% export ORIC

	Of course, you can set the variable once in your autoexec.bat, .profile,
	.login, etc.

	NB: Please always include the final / or \

Linux users:
	Euphoric needs access rights to physical IO ports : VGA card and
	soundcard.  You should install it as "setuid root".
	Type in the following commands :

		% su
		Password : <root-passwd>
		# chown root euphoric
		# chmod u+s euphoric
		# exit
		%

	Euphoric runs in a virtual console. If you use X11, type Ctrl-Alt-F2
	for example to switch to a virtual console and start euphoric in full
	screen there. When you exit from euphoric, you usually switch back to
	the X11 screen with Alt-F7.

DOS users:
	Euphoric needs a DPMI server: such a server is included in Windows or
	OS/2, but not in DOS. You can either use a free DPMI server (CWSDPMI)
	or a commercial one (QuaterDeck, 386MAX, etc). If you want to use
	CWSDPMI, you just need to place the cwsdpmi.exe program in a directory
	pointed by the PATH variable (or in the current directory), it will be
	automatically loaded by euphoric.
	Also note that when using smartdrv, you should't switch off your pc
	before exiting a program (there is no exception with euphoric).

2. Booting an Oric
------------------

You choose an Oric type with parameters on the command line : Euphoric emulates
an Oric1/Atmos with tapes, or an Oric1/Atmos with floppy disks, or a Telestrat.

Examples:
	euphoric
		starts an Atmos with tapes (if you want an Oric-1, you just have
		to replace the Oric.ROM file with an image of Oric-1's rom)

	euphoric sedoric3.dsk
		starts an Atmos with a Microdisc controller and boots on the
		sedoric3.dsk disk.
		Windows and OS/2 users: you may use drag&drop to boot a disk,
		or you may associate the ".dsk" extension to euphoric program.

	euphoric -j ftdos.dsk
		starts an Atmos with a Jasmin controller and a ftdos.dsk disk
		in first drive.

	euphoric -t stratsed.dsk
		starts a Telestrat and loads the Stratsed operating system from
		the stratsed.dsk disk.

3. Help and configuration
-------------------------

A configuration screen is accessible with the F1 key. This screen allows you to:

	- eject and insert disks in the drives
	- enable hardware emulation of tapes (for nostalgics of lengthy loading
	of tapes), choose a tape and control the virtual tape player.
	- modify clock speed of the oric
	- switch to an oric keyboard or a PC keyboard
	- select a communication port
	- disable/enable sound

The OUI (Oric User Interface) works with arrow keys, Enter to select and ESC to
quit. During file selection, page scrolling is possible with shift+arrows.

The configuration screen also reminds you the meaning of function keys you may
use during emulation:

	F1	Display/Hide the help line
	F2	Sound on/off switch
	F3	PC/Oric keyboard
	F6	Jasmin boot
	F7	Reset Button of the Oric
	F8	Power plug (power on reset)
	F9	Dump the state of the oric and exit
	F10	Exit emulator

4. Read the manual
------------------

Read the manual, and you will know all about tape and disk images, Oric to PC
transfers, joysticks, RS232, printer, programmable PC keyboard, Telestrat, etc.
