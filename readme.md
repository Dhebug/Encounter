# Introduction
"Encounter" is a text adventure game released in 1983 by Severn Software on multiple 8bit computers of the time, including the Oric 1 and Atmos.

The program itself is quite simple, 100% written in BASIC and sold on tapes, and this repository is my attempt at improving the game:
- The **Upgrade Time Episodes** folder contains snapshots of the work done on the BASIC source code while I was making YouTube videos about it.
- The **FloppyBuilderVersion** folder is the current state of the project, started from scratch to use C and assembler instead

The game is not finished and still being worked on.
