This book is the <I>Oric 1 Manual</I>, by <B>John SCRIVEN</B>. <br>
It's a good book, but less complete than the Atmos manual.  <br>
The left one is the original UK edition, and the right one is the French version. <br>

This book is <I>The COMPANION to the ORIC 1</I>, by <B>Ian Adamson</B>. <br>
It's really a great book. <br>
In this book you can find how plug and use your Oric Computer (nice !), and you get a brief description of how a computer works. <br>
Next chapters learn you the way of programming in Basic language, to do graphics and sounds. <br>
At the end, you can find an introduction to machine code, and many appendices covering ASCII tables, escape codes,
error messages, memory map, MCP 40 printer commands, I/O connectors, and many other interesting stuffs. <br><br>
It will become the official reference manual sold with Atmos computer (see below) <br><br>

The Black manual is the Atmos version of "the Companion"
The Pink book is the french version of the black manual. 
The translation is very good. And the white add on covers some mising topics.<br><br>
The last book is the Swedish version of the Oric Atmos manual by <B>Peter Jonsson</B>.<br>
It is a guide for first time users and it's very thin, only 75 pages. But it is very well written and covers most of the
chapters from the english manual.

The <I>Guide Pratique de l'Oric</I> was sell with the Oric 1 in 1983 as an Oric manual. (Edited by Cedic/Nathan) <br>
Authors are <B>Michel Bussac</B> and <B>Robert Lagoutte</B>, with pictures by <B>Dominique Carrara</B> <br>
It talk about the Oric's usage, then go to the Basic explanations. Really a good book for beginers. Gives syntax and examples
for every functions. And the pictures are interesting too. <br>

<IMG  SRC="pics/redball.gif" ALIGN="middle" WIDTH=17 HEIGHT=17>
This book (<I>Au coeur de l'Oric Atmos</I>) is my favorite Oric book so far. Mr <B>Gilles Bertin</B> gives very interesting
informations. <br>
Topics covered are an hardware description of the Oric, how to create some weird graphics mode mixing High and Low resolution,
How to scan the keyboard (using the FUNC key), to program a real time clock, read joysticks, modify datas in basic, using 
floating point code in assembly language,.... and finaly a near complete disassembly of the ROM ! <br>
Great no ?

Some english programming books. <br>
[No description available for Advanced User book] <br><br>

The second book is <I>The Oric Programmer</I> by <B>S.M.Gee</B> and <B>Mike James</B>. <br>
Not as comprehensive as the advanced user guide but many small tips if you want to be a better Oric-programmer.

<IMG  SRC="pics/redball.gif" ALIGN="middle" WIDTH=17 HEIGHT=17>
A book from <B>Frederic Blanc</B> and <B>Francois Normant</B>. (Edited by ASN diffusion) <br>
The first 4 pages talks about the Oric itself, and then about the screen, initialisations and protections, the Rom functions, etc... <br>
 It's a very small book, but with enough descriptions to turn around the Oric and get good time doing poke stuff, and 6502 coding.

Nothing about clock-cycles, but it's a pretty good book for starting 6502 programming. <br>
Some interesting considerations about anti-piracy tricks. <br>

And another french book that can helps you to learn 6502. <br>
I really do not like it, since it's full of misstyping. And some "dirty code". <br>
I'm ok to use self-modifying code, but in a book you have to explain that this kind of code cannot be executed in ROM. <br>
And the author is happy to use some stupid features like "opcode" overloading. <br>
(That means that depending of where you start to disassemble, the code have different meanings). <br>
Somewhere disturbing. I say. <br>

The first one, by <B>Jacques Boisgontier</B> and <B>Sophie Brebion</B> is a kind of Oric Basic programming manual. <br>
It's well written, and very progressive. Many sample programs doing graphics animations and so on.... <br>
<br>
The second one, of the same author, is an extension of the previous one. With programs for exercise, education, gestion, games... <br>

Many small basic programs, most of them are pretty good. From games like Alien to Bioryth-program. A good book for a starter.

If think it's a good book for hardware people who want to do some Oric's extensions.
