<IMG SRC="pics/redball.gif" ALIGN="middle" WIDTH=17 HEIGHT=17> <B>Who is Dbug ???</B><BR>
Hello folks. Dbug is the nickname I took years ago when I was programming on my Good Old Oric Atmos.
But you can call me Mike as well !
My real name is <B>Mickaël POINTIER</B>, and I'm a frenchman (Or a frog eater ?).
I'm a programmer, and I like to do some stupid things as coding some programs on Oric in the year 1997 !
Many people in my neighborhood think I'm a little bit crazy, and especially one of my collegues !<BR>

<IMG  SRC="pics/redball.gif" ALIGN="middle" WIDTH=17 HEIGHT=17> <B>Favorite occupations !</B><BR>
As many programers, I'm using much of my free time on computers. But I don't do only that ! When I'm not on internet or on IRC, I
also do other things... <BR>
I enjoy spending time with my "little arkansan" girlfriend (who is in France with me).
I like to listen music (Mr Bowie, The Smashings,  many movie soundtracks, sometimes classical music like the great Vivaldi,
and some more common styles like U2... nobody is perfect). <BR>
When the weather is cold, I also like to do <B>SnowBoard</B> (By the way, you must try the 'Flow' boots they are really great !). <BR>
And the rest of the time, I read Sci-Fi books. Ever read Douglas Adams "hitchhickers guide to the galaxy" ???? <BR>
<BR>


<IMG  SRC="pics/redball.gif" ALIGN="middle"  WIDTH=17 HEIGHT=17> <B>Do I know computers ???</B><BR>
I think yes. I started computing when I was 11 years old, and bought my first computer the following year.
It was a wonderful Oric with a powerful 6502 processor...
Many years after, I got an Atari ST computer (still alive... but very wounded !).
The next one was an Atari Falcon.
And now, I'm typing this text on FlexED32, under Windows 95 running on a Cyrix P166+ (Don't like monopoles...)
with a good HardDrive and a good Fat32,... that's cool ! <br>
My lastest additions to the PC are a Zip Drive and a HP Scanjet IIc... Cool for the pictures !

By the way, I'm still looking for an Oric Atmos (or Telestrat) with Floppy drives. If you've got one, please send me an Email !

<IMG  SRC="pics/redball.gif"  ALIGN="middle" WIDTH=17 HEIGHT=17> <B>What's my current job ???</B><BR>
After a few years in the university, I got a good job in a little French Company called <B>Adeline Software</B>, 
as PlayStation(TM) Programer. It was a nice job, and the PlayStation was really a nice machine. <br>
In 1996, I worked on the game <B>Time Commando</B>, and in 1997 on <b>Little Big Adventure</b>. <br>
For more information on these games, click on the PlayStation button. <br>
<br>
As life is a perpetual movement, I left Adeline Software.  Now, I'm working for <B>Heliovisions Productions</B>.
Look for our new productions ! And especially for Hexplore, a great RPG/Adventure game available soon ! <br><br>
