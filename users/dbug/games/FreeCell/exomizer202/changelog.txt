  decrunch effect. Bug reported by Csabo/LOD.
+ Fix bug that prevented the correct error message from showing when trying to
  combine a basic start and a non rom config for the sfx command.  Bug reported
  by iAN CooG.

  lower than debug. Bug report by iAN CooG.

Release of 2.0 source code, Win32 and DOS binaries.
+ Fix bug in sfx decruncher setup where data was copied unnecessary. Triggered
  by using -Di_load_addr, reported by nbla000
+ Add i_line_number symbol to be able to change the default line number of the
  basic line of the sfx decruncher. Feature suggested by Chicken
+ 6502 emulator core now features memory read/write callbacks
+ Add desfx -e flag to override the automatic entry point detection, feature
  suggestion with patch by iAN CooG/HokutoForce. (Patch reworked somewhat,
  error handling added)
+ Fix desfx handling of files that decrunch to and including 0xffff, Bug report
  with patch by iAN CooG/HokutoForce. (Patch reworked somewhat, end addresses
  are exclusive everywhere else)

2008-09-08
Release of 2.0beta7 source code, Win32 and DOS binaries.
+ Refactored some functions from exo_main.c and exo_helper.c into a new file,
  exo_util.c so the testprogram could use them too.
+ Fixed a bug in exo_main where the sys/call basic token was mixed up with
  the basic_txt_start. This confused thes sfx sys sub-command.
+ Fixed a bug in krilldecr.s. The handling of literal sequences longer than
  256 bytes was broken.
+ Added a testprogram to test that the decrunchers in the exodecrs folder
  works. This feature uses the 6502 emulation core to run test programs. It
  tests literal sequences longer than 256 bytes and run lengths longer than 256
  bytes for all four decruncher variants, backward, forward, streaming and
  chunk streaming.
+ Added a z80 decruncher contributed by Metalbrain.
+ Added an experimental desfx command that should be able to decrunch sfx
  crunched files. Uses the 6502 emulation core to run the sfx-decrunchers.
+ Added a 6502 emulator core.
+ Fix rare situation when sfxdecr.s failed to assemble.
+ Improve the help text when no sub-command is given.
+ Improve the handling of ROM/RAM-banking and NMIs for the atari target in the
  sfx decruncher.
+ Fix broken op definition ldy abs,x in the sfx assembler, bug reported by
   Stefano Tognon.

2007-05-13
Prerelease of 2.0beta7 source code, Win32 and DOS binaries.
+ Add loading of Oric tap files to the sfx command.
+ Add support for microcontroller RAM to Oric sfx target.
+ Add flags to customize enter and exit code for the sfx sub-command.
+ The level and mem sub-commands now output more info about the generated file.

2007-01-28
Release of 2.0beta6 source code, Win32 and DOS binaries.
+ Fix c128 target bugs in the sfx command
+ Add an experimental Oric 1 target to the sfx command.

2006-10-08
Release of 2.0beta5 source code, Win32 and DOS binaries.
+ Add a decruncher able to decrunch forwards, exodepack.s, contributed by
  Krill/Plush.
+ Add support for forward crunching to the mem and level sub commands.
+ Remove broken usage of membuf_append that breaks on big-endian targets. Bug
  reported by MagerValp.
+ Add a dasm version of the exodecruncher source.

2006-07-08
Release of 2.0beta4 source code, Win32 and DOS binaries.
+ Change my email address (again).
+ Added option to the Apple target to disconnect the loaded DOS.
+ Fix length field error in generated Apple II file header.
+ Don't use setjmp/longjmp due to obscure bug when building for mingw with -O3
  -fomit-frame-pointer. Bug reported by iAN CooG/HokutoForce.
+ Add multipass functionality to the assembler in order to be able to do more
  complex things in the decruncher source.
+ fix the sfx decruncher to work for a wider range of i_load_addr values.
  Bug reported by iAN CooG/HokutoForce.
+ Add optional offset,len for raw command file reading.

2005-11-14
Release of 2.0beta3 source code, win32 and dos binaries.
+ i_ram_exit bug for the C64 target found by iAN CooG/HokutoForce fixed.
+ Effect shorthands -n for no effect, -x1 for Accumulator based border flash,
  -x2 for X-register based border flash and -x3 for Y-register based border
  flash. -x<fast effect assembler fragment> -X<slow effect assembler fragment>
+ removed the i_fast_effect symbol. Now border effects are fast and blinking
  char is slow.
+ Added flag -x<effect assembler fragment> to the sfx command.
+ Improved docs about the mem command and assembler symbols.
+ fixed spelling bug in i_effect=2 mode. Bug found by iAN CooG/HokutoForce.

2005-11-02
Release of 2.0beta2 win32 and dos binaries.
+ added results for canterbury and calgary corpae.
+ beginning a documentation section in exo20info.txt
+ changed the exoraw binary into a sub command of exomizer.
+ renamed symbols i_(ram|irq)_on_(entering|exit) to i_(ram|irq)_(enter|exit)
+ renamed symboli_config_effect to i_effect
+ added symbols i_(ram|irq)_during.
+ added new sfx target -t 168 ($a8), The Atari 400/800 XL/XE computer family.
