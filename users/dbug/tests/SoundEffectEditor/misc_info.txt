	Reading/writing registers of the chip allows to control the powerful
	features. A register is read or written when the chip is selected and
	the low four address bits indicate the desired register:

As two select lines of the PSG (BC1 and BDIR) are connected to the CA2 and CB2 lines of the VIA, you have to ensure the PCR (Peripheral Control Register) of the 6522 is correctly set in order to communicate with the PSG. 
As explained before, data to/from the PSG flows through a secondary bus connected to port A of the VIA. Selecting the PSG means asking it to read a register number (selecting one of its register), or reading/writing the previously selected register. 
Here are the four combinations: 
   
BDIR	BC1	
0		0		PSG not selected
0		1		Read PSG register
1		0		Write PSG register
1		1		Index register of PSG selected

Last but not least, note that register 14 (0Eh) of the PSG is an IO port (other flavors of the PSG, 8910 and 8913, have 0 or 2 IO ports). 
On the Oric, this IO port is used to select a column in the keyboard matrix, see the Keyboard chapter.	

From Twilighte's post on the forum: (http://forum.defence-force.org/viewtopic.php?t=30)

The AY-3-8912 is linked to the system by the way of one data/register port and 2 control lines. 
 The control lines are known as CA2 and CB2 since they are held within the VIA 6522 and may be set/reset in Memory location $030C. 
 The Data/Register Port is also used by the Printer Port (Which may also be attached to a joystick interface) and appears at location $030F. 

 The control line Register (Also known as the PCR) actually controls the behaviour of CA1,CA2,CB1 and CB2, but for the most part, we can get away with 3 values directly poked into this location. 
 The three values are... 
 $DD == $030F is inactive 
 $FD == $030F holds data for a preset Register 
 $FF == $030F holds a Register number

 So to write the value of 15 into register 8 (Volume of channel A) the following code could be used... 
 
	LDA #8 'Set the register to 8 
	STA $030F 
	LDA #$FF 
	STA $030C 
	LDA #$DD 
	STA $030C 
	
	LDA #15 'Set the Value for this register 
	STA $030F 
	LDA #$FD 
	STA $030C 
	LDA #$DD 'Reset the state of the control lines 
	STA $030C 
	
Write to location 0314 : 
   
bit 7: Eprom select (active low) 
bit 6-5: drive select (0 to 3) 
bit 4: side select 
bit 3: double density enable (0: double density, 1: single density) 
bit 2: along with bit 3, selects the data separator clock divisor            (1: double density, 0: single-density) 
bit 1: ROMDIS (active low). When 0, internal Basic rom is disabled. 
bit 0: enable FDC INTRQ to appear on read location $0314 and to drive cpu IRQ
