Installation for dxa
--------------------

dxa should build out of the box with any even vaguely recent version of gcc.
You might need to do some tweakage for non-Unix systems or cc. I have tested
it on AIX, NetBSD and Mac OS X/Darwin. -- Cameron Kaiser

1. Uncomment LONG_OPTIONS in options.h if you have getopts_long() and want
   long options (--example). This is purely optional.
2. Edit the Makefile and make sure your compiler and CFLAGS make sense. The
   default works for most people.
3. "make"
4. Documentation in man format is in dxa.1.

Please keep in mind this is still considered "alpha" software and there may
be bugs, which is why it is not part of the official xa distribution yet.
