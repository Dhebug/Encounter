TODO LIST AND BUGS

* Einstein sometimes is sat along with a small child
-> This is because when a kid is knocked down by a punch or
pellet, when he gets up, he recovers his old animatory state
Occurs because Angelface and Boy Wander hit with the teacher
present, but I guess Eric can do this too!

Punch a seated kid, while others look for a seat. Someone finds 
the seat empty and sits down. Then the punched kid gets up and sits
along with the new one.

* Angelface hits always and too quickly. If we put back
  the pla's then it doesn't but tries to hit Eric forever
  if you don't move

* Boy Wander fires too much?

* Pellet collision is not correct against teachers or walls

* It is sometimes difficult to fire a pellet

* Does Boy Wander's pellet bounce?

* Pellets sometimes do not hit teachers?

* Rockitt sometimes ask to write an essay with a title, but he is
  in the map room... Maybe this is corrected when the
  routines to write on blackboards are done?

* The bubble lip gets at the wrong place when teacher next to the right border 
(seems the bubble is one tile left, but the lip is not)
