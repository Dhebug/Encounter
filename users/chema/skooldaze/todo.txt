TODO LIST AND BUGS

* Einstein sometimes is sat along with a small child
-> This is because when a kid is knocked down by a punch or
pellet, when he gets up, he recovers his old animatory state
Occurs because Angelface and Boy Wander hit with the teacher
present, but I guess Eric can do this too!

Punch a seated kid, while others look for a seat. Someone finds 
the seat empty and sits down. Then the punched kid gets up and sits
along with the new one.

* Angelface hits always and too quickly. If we put back
  the pla's then it doesn't but tries to hit Eric forever
  if you don't move

* Boy Wander fires too much?

* Pellet collision is not correct against teachers or walls

* It is sometimes difficult to fire a pellet

* Pellets sometimes do not hit teachers?

* Exam room not visible completely

* It is a bit strange that the teacher writes someting, then
  starts asking unrelated questions.

* Eric can write on blackboard, but seems that only on CAPS

* Teachers are drawn over seats (when they are at the blackboard, thus behind them) but behind seated kids.

* Teachers should have a greater range of vision (tile size)

* Most times "Sorry Sir... Eric hit me" has no response (when the teacher does not believe Einstein).


- Mr Withit in the reading room walks outside the right side

- Does Boy Wander's pellet bounce?

- Once it happened that the teacher started wiping the blackboard facing righ, which made him walk right and passed
beyond the reading room wall...

- Eric is flagged as inside the exam room when he is just near the entrance

- When looking for absent Eric Mr Withit goes from Map room to reading room, using the middle floor and trespassing the middle wall.

- Why are there two red bands on the name and title of the character when changing names (some times)? The inverse
bit is not unset in all the buffer?

- CAUTION: A pellet ending on the left side of the school is not removed (?)

- When looking for absent Eric Mr Withit goes from Map room to reading room, using the middle floor and trespassing the middle wall.

- Sometimes the blackboard is flagged as clean when it is not (teachers or BW write on it)

- Write an essay when the teacher did not write anything

- It seems that always the message is mumps duty in special playtime, though
  the logic changes...

- In demo mode, after some time (DINNER), Oricutron hangs... Euphoric too. Stack is corrupted and rti jumps to brk
	lda counter (which is 0 always?)
	beq toldaagain

- In demo mode score should not increase (hi-score too!)

- In demo mode, after some time (DINNER), Oricutron hangs... Euphoric too. Stack is corrupted and rti jumps to brk

- First two column tiles are not shown (due to protecting the SRB)?

- When ending game message is being told (10000 lines) sometimes, at the end
  Mr Wacker teleports and the cycle starts again?

- Jumping twice causes Eric to fall below the floor.

- When jumping again over a boy teachers issue a "THIS ROOM IS PRIVATE" 
punishment (as check Eric loc fails and the hack adjusting pos_row with the
flag JUMPING does not do the tick).
 
- When Eric jumps s_check_Eric_loc fails, so Einstein grasses on Eric's absence
and other matters. I guess that modifying get_Eric_Ycoord so it returns the
actual floor if Eric is jumping (as he cannot jump when on the staircase) could 
do the trick.

- You can sit on the bank in dinner room??? 
  (checking chairs from middle floor it seems)...

- When looking for Eric which_way seems to fail on certain occasions
  resulting in the teacher being lost?
 ( Goes downstairs to first floor and continue into the depths of the unknown)
