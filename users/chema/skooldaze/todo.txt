TODO LIST AND BUGS

* Einstein sometimes is sat along with a small child
-> This is because when a kid is knocked down by a punch or
pellet, when he gets up, he recovers his old animatory state
Occurs because Angelface and Boy Wander hit with the teacher
present, but I guess Eric can do this too!

Punch a seated kid, while others look for a seat. Someone finds 
the seat empty and sits down. Then the punched kid gets up and sits
along with the new one.

* Angelface hits always and too quickly. If we put back
  the pla's then it doesn't but tries to hit Eric forever
  if you don't move

* Boy Wander fires too much?

* Pellet collision is not correct against teachers or walls

* It is sometimes difficult to fire a pellet

* Does Boy Wander's pellet bounce?

* Pellets sometimes do not hit teachers?

* Exam room not visible completely

* Mr withit in the reading room walks outside the right side

* I saw Mr Wacker writting on the exam blackboard from the middle
  of the class... Maybe when no need to erase the blackboard?
  Also happened in the white room after Einstein grassing on Eric's absence
  and then the teacher changing the schema of the class, writting someting on 
  the blackboard.
* It is a bit strange that the teacher writes someting, then
  starts asking unrelated questions.
