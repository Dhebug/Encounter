TODO LIST AND BUGS

* Children sometimes share a chair (bug in the original)

Punch a seated kid, while others look for a seat. Someone finds 
the seat empty and sits down. Then the punched kid gets up and sits
along with the new one.

* Angelface hits always and too quickly. If we put back
  the pla's then it doesn't but tries to hit Eric forever
  if you don't move

* Boy Wander fires too much?

* Exam room not visible completely

* It is a bit strange that the teacher writes someting, then
  starts asking unrelated questions (same in the original)

* Eric can write on blackboard, but seems that only on CAPS

* Waiting for counter to reach 2 is too much. Only 1 is too little... What can I do?

* Try to use which_way (generating a which_way_ex) to indicate through arrows where Eric should move
  This will be active only if Eric is not where he should be and it is not playtime and during the first minutes of
  play to help newbies find the correct way to the classroom... Can this be done?

* Seems that when at Revision Library Eric can be where he wants...

* In demo mode lines should not be added, as game does not restart.

- Adjust timings for actions and tweaks in duration of playtimes when in special playtimes.

- Twice erasing boards is wrong

- Be sure Einstein grasses on Eric only when it is true.

- Dinner position of kids is too lefty.

- Creak's year should be decompressed before copied to creak_year

- Mr Wacker trespassed middle floor wall from the exam room (was too close to it?)

- Once boy 10 got the wrong animstate, after a class when delivering a message to Eric

- Check battle years (some might be wrong)

- White room is not white

- Bonus for opening the safe and hitting the 15 shields

- Eric is not correctly set back to front always after taking stairs (related to moving up/down using left/right keys).

- Need to sort tab_safecodes correctly to generate the password (Mr Wacker comes first)

- Teachers should have a greater range of vision (tile size related?)

- Set the three lines of text to zeros

- Comment all the code related to correct rendering order

- Teachers are drawn over seats (when they are at the blackboard, thus behind them) but behind seated kids 
  (same in the original)

- Found difficulties for hitting a shield with a bouncing pellet... need to check if it is related to the direction
  it is facing.

- Eric punches too slowly

- 6x6=2???

- Does the bell sound between two consecutive playtimes? It shouldn't

- Observed corruption in the anim_state for a character. For a small boy delivering a message,
  and also for Eric when jumping. Could be related to the code for detecting shield hits?

- Most times "Sorry Sir... Eric hit me" has no response (when the teacher does not believe Einstein).

- Still hangs on Dinner.
NOTE: PROBABLY SOLVED OTHER BUGS HERE... it was the kludge to 
go to the second-to-last GOTO command in s_isc_findEric

- Pellet collision is not correct against teachers or walls

- It is sometimes difficult to fire a pellet

- Pellets sometimes do not hit teachers?

- Mr Withit in the reading room walks outside the right side

- Does Boy Wander's pellet bounce?

- Once it happened that the teacher started wiping the blackboard facing righ, which made him walk right and passed
beyond the reading room wall...

- Eric is flagged as inside the exam room when he is just near the entrance

- When looking for absent Eric Mr Withit goes from Map room to reading room, using the middle floor and trespassing the middle wall.

- Why are there two red bands on the name and title of the character when changing names (some times)? The inverse
bit is not unset in all the buffer?

- CAUTION: A pellet ending on the left side of the school is not removed (?)

- When looking for absent Eric Mr Withit goes from Map room to reading room, using the middle floor and trespassing the middle wall.

- Sometimes the blackboard is flagged as clean when it is not (teachers or BW write on it)

- Write an essay when the teacher did not write anything

- It seems that always the message is mumps duty in special playtime, though
  the logic changes...

- In demo mode, after some time (DINNER), Oricutron hangs... Euphoric too. Stack is corrupted and rti jumps to brk
	lda counter (which is 0 always?)
	beq toldaagain

- In demo mode score should not increase (hi-score too!)

- In demo mode, after some time (DINNER), Oricutron hangs... Euphoric too. Stack is corrupted and rti jumps to brk

- First two column tiles are not shown (due to protecting the SRB)?

- When ending game message is being told (10000 lines) sometimes, at the end
  Mr Wacker teleports and the cycle starts again?

- Jumping twice causes Eric to fall below the floor.

- When jumping again over a boy teachers issue a "THIS ROOM IS PRIVATE" 
punishment (as check Eric loc fails and the hack adjusting pos_row with the
flag JUMPING does not do the tick).
 
- When Eric jumps s_check_Eric_loc fails, so Einstein grasses on Eric's absence
and other matters. I guess that modifying get_Eric_Ycoord so it returns the
actual floor if Eric is jumping (as he cannot jump when on the staircase) could 
do the trick.

- You can sit on the bank in dinner room??? 
  (checking chairs from middle floor it seems)...

- When looking for Eric which_way seems to fail on certain occasions
  resulting in the teacher being lost?
 ( Goes downstairs to first floor and continue into the depths of the unknown)
