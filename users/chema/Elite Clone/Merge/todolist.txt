+ AddSpaceObject needs tmp0 pointing to a coordinate structure, but it is allways _PosX. 
Should we change this, or at least add another routine that loads the tmp0 pointer?


+ Elite TNK uses the current galactic seed (6bytes) to create planets. As this seed may be corrupt (whenever used for creating
a galactic chart or to find a planet), I will use the system's seed of 4 bytes (base for goatsoup).


+ When saving the laser vertex there is no check to see if it is not a ship (something like a planet)
         beq normal
         cmp #5           ; is it 1,2 or 4 ? Then planet, sun or moon
         bcc checkmin    ; skip max check
normal


+ When drawing planets, if they are too close, maybe it is better not to draw them // if 0x6000/Z > 0xff then return  (too close to draw?)

+ A certain hysteresis would be needed to avoid planets appearing and disappearing as we rotate.

+ Look in tineloop.s

        jsr clr_hires
        jsr load_frame
        jsr _DrawFrameBorder   
        jsr _DoubleBuffOn
        jsr _FirstFrame

If DrawFrameBorder is called before load_frame there is a bug the second time we switch from screen2 to frontview (the frame is erased at the bottom).

+ Adapt the ship diameter (size) from the data to the scaled-down versions generated by modelimport (see out.txt in the modelimport folder).

+ PROBLEM: Seems that rotating 3 degrees is too much for easy targeting the enemy!!! That requires modifications in the engine for the player!!!

+ Cannot add color if the frame is in pixel 5. If it is not, the frame should be drawn at every screen dump?

+ Implement a Cargo screen

+ Check and manage fuel

+ Buy/manage equipment

+ Create enemies dynamically

+ Missiles should not destroy planets... (should never target them!). Is this solved now?

+ Complete AI

+ Implement ECM for missiles

+ Implement the kill-values
