+ AddSpaceObject needs tmp0 pointing to a coordinate structure, but it is allways _PosX. 
Should we change this, or at least add another routine that loads the tmp0 pointer?


+ Elite TNK uses the current galactic seed (6bytes) to create planets. As this seed may be corrupt (whenever used for creating
a galactic chart or to find a planet), I will use the system's seed of 4 bytes (base for goatsoup).


+ When saving the laser vertex there is no check to see if it is not a ship (something like a planet)
         beq normal
         cmp #5           ; is it 1,2 or 4 ? Then planet, sun or moon
         bcc checkmin    ; skip max check
normal


+ Make a better circle routine. All those checks for clipping are destroying performance. Also something like:
int circle(int x, int y, int size) {
  // first check circle -
  //  x + size < lhs of screen fails
  //  x - size > rhs of screen fails 
  //  y + size < top of screen fails
  //  y - size > bot of screen fails

  // CHKON 3C28
  int lhs = x-size;  // lhs of circle
  int rhs = x+size;

  if ( (rhs < CLIP_X_MIN) || ( lhs > CLIP_X_MAX) )
    return 0;

  int top = y - size;  // top of circle
  int bot = y + size;
  if ( (bot < CLIP_X_MIN) || ( top > CLIP_Y_MAX) )
    return 0;
may help, won't it?

+ When drawing planets, if they are too close, maybe it is better not to draw them // if 0x6000/Z > 0xff then return  (too close to draw?)

+ Check distance with planets to implement collisions with them. Maybe at the time of drawing we could set a flag warn_heigth or something? 
Maybe do the same for docking?

+ Look in tineloop.s

        jsr clr_hires
        jsr load_frame
        jsr _DrawFrameBorder   
        jsr _DoubleBuffOn
        jsr _FirstFrame

If DrawFrameBorder is called before load_frame there is a bug the second time we switch from screen2 to frontview (the frame is erased at the bottom).

+ DrawLaser, DrawCrosshair and DrawFrameBorder (tactics.s), should use a common Draw4Lines function...!
