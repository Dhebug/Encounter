+ AddSpaceObject needs tmp0 pointing to a coordinate structure, but it is allways _PosX. 
Should we change this, or at least add another routine that loads the tmp0 pointer?


+ Elite TNK uses the current galactic seed (6bytes) to create planets. As this seed may be corrupt (whenever used for creating
a galactic chart or to find a planet), I will use the system's seed of 4 bytes (base for goatsoup).


+ When saving the laser vertex there is no check to see if it is not a ship (something like a planet)
         beq normal
         cmp #5           ; is it 1,2 or 4 ? Then planet, sun or moon
         bcc checkmin    ; skip max check
normal


+ When drawing planets, if they are too close, maybe it is better not to draw them // if 0x6000/Z > 0xff then return  (too close to draw?)

+ A certain hysteresis would be needed to avoid planets appearing and disappearing as we rotate.

+ Look in tineloop.s
notdocked
        jsr clr_hires
        jsr load_frame
        jsr _DrawFrameBorder   
        jsr _DoubleBuffOn
        jsr _FirstFrame

If DrawFrameBorder is called before load_frame there is a bug the second time we switch from screen2 to frontview (the frame is erased at the bottom).

+ Adapt the ship diameter (size) from the data to the scaled-down versions generated by modelimport (see out.txt in the modelimport folder).

+ PROBLEM: Seems that rotating 3 degrees is too much for easy targeting the enemy!!! That requires modifications in the engine for the player!!!

+ Cannot add color if the frame is in pixel 5. If it is not, the frame should be drawn at every screen dump?

+ Implement a Cargo screen

+ Check and manage fuel

+ Buy/manage equipment

+ Create enemies dynamically

+ Missiles should not destroy planets... (should never target them!). Is this solved now?

+ Complete AI

+ Implement ECM for missiles

+ Remove inflight messages afer jumping/docking...

+ Update ship's energy, in a timely manner and to maximum when dock (or before leaving the planet)

+ Bounties added, but it is quite a waste to use 2 bytes for just a couple of cases... Anyway the inflight message with
the bounty appears maybe too fast? Maybe even before the ship explodes!

+ Scooping is implemented, but it seems that randomly creating the loot harldy creates anything (not even plates). 
Don't know what is going on here... should check. UPDATE: Seems OK now (but still prob is low).

+ When your ship is destroyed, sometimes everything seems to hung. No apparent reason, but maybe too many objects? 
Seems not quite probable. Hard to make this repeatable.

+ damage_ship needs a look... it is quite a disaster. DONE. Also modified damage_player to be sure to decouple it...

+ I am not sure when, but sometimes increment_kills is called with wrong parameters and fails... Target the ADDER and destroy it when nearby to see. Maybe it was because of the lack of memory? reducing MAXSHIPS to 10 seems to have solved this.

+ After moving the laser origin and destination points for drawing to page 4, as they are not initialized, four erroneous lines appear at the first time space is draw.

+ The first time we go back from a text screen to space view, the three lines of text go black paper. Also sometimes @ chars appear... Too low on memory?, but why if we are not creating new objects? Maybe we are copying more lines than necessary for drawing the cockpit?

+ Check the escape pod flags. When killing the ADDER it seems that _flags FLG_INNOCENT is not set (?)

+ Our explosion is not quite good... be sure to launch splinters, at least... Ok now it allways launches splinters, but need more MAXOBJS to work. 10 are too low.
