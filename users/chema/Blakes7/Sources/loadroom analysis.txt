What to do in LoadRoom
SCUMM analysis
There is a LoadRoom script funciton, but it seems to only ensure
the associated resource is loaded calling ensureResourceLoaded
The job is done in LoadRoomWithEgo, which is much more complex
In script_v5 LoadRoom also calls startScene (room.cpp) which does:

-Stop actors talking
-Call fadeOut and updates fade effects
-If there is a script running nukeArrays
-runExitScript -> runs script number in VAR_EXIT_SCRIPT (script.cpp). It may be a single script with different entry points (?)
-killScriptsAndResources
-hides actors and initializes things
-makes sure the room is loaded (ensureResourceLoaded)
-clearRoomObjects
-	setupRoomSubBlocks(); -> setup all the room pointers (also called after restoring game)
				Also gets pointers to the Entry/Exit scripts (inside the room data)
				and pointers to all the local scripts
	resetRoomSubBlocks(); -> other dynamic data of the room (such as walkboxes) which can be modified
				by scripts, so it cannot be called after restoring a game)
- resetRoomObjects	-> reads from the room data the local objects, load their resources and setup data. (object.cpp)
- Sets up room width, heigth, max camera movements, etc.
- Show Actors
- Mark ego as not positioned and
- runEntryScript
- if game version is 1 or 2 it runs script 5
- 	

When calling runScript, it also calls runScriptNested which executes until script deschedules. Looking at the above code it seems that both the
entry and exit scripts are run until descheduled, then all are reset.
