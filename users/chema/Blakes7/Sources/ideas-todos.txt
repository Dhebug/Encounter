From Greymagick
D * En la escena de la entrada a la cueva, no es obvio como caminar sobre las piedras.
 Cuando usas el leño el mensaje dice "Walk to Stone" pero el éxito de ejecutar el 
 comando depende de la posición de Blake. Para pasar a las otras piedras simplemente 
 basta hacer clic en ellas y no hay un "Walk to Stone" equivalente. 
 Sería mucho más lógico crear un objeto "Shore" al otro lado y que "Walk to Shore" 
 solo se pudiera ejecutar si estamos ya sobre la piedra inicial.

D * En la entrada a la base, si inmediatamente después de entrar Blake sale, 
entonces ya no puede volver a entrar: "Walk to Door" no hace nada. Al menos no he
encontrado manera. Entrar parece que depende de la cinemática anterior.

D* Si le decimos al robot de la lavandería que no tenemos el código
y que si hay algo que podríamos hace, responde "Sorry, I can't". 
Eso no concuerda, así que es mejor que diga simplemente "Sorry".

D * El guardia del bloque prisión dice "Civils cannot enter here". Debería decir 
"Civilians", que si no se refiere a gente educada, no a civiles. :)

D * Al mensaje "It's full of coffee" le falta el punto.

* No parece muy lógico ponerse el uniforme en presencia del otro guardia. 
Tendría más sentido ponérselo en el baño. Si esto es una limitación del script 
y te da problemas cambiarlo, no tiene mucha importancia.

D * "Noone" es incorrecto (hoy en día al menos, en la época de Lord Byron tenía 
un pase). Mejor reemplazar por "No one".

D * "I need to tamper the clock time" es incorrecto porque "tamper" no es transitivo.
 Sería "I need to tamper with the clock time". Igualmente, "We need to alter the hour"
 suena rarísimo, lo correcto sería "We need to change the time" pero eso es muy ambiguo.
 Mi sugerencia es "We need to hack the clock" que es exactamente lo que Vila hace, y además usa el mismo número de caracteres. :)

D * El guardia dice "But fist the watchword", debe ser "first".

D * Cally dice "They bought someone", debería ser "brought".

D * Travis dice "imprissoned", debe ser "imprisoned". Aunque "arrested" es más natural en este contexto.

D * Debe decir "Transponder" en el nombre del objeto.



Thigs yet to do:
================

- GUARD keeps looking at you after drinking coffee.
- Examining coffee after changing for decaf does not change description and should

Nice-To-Have:
- Highlighting in inventory
- Add scSetPalette(attr1,attr2) and scSetRoomPalette();
- Check because stringpacks with objectcode are a risk (they can be nuked and would not be loaded back).
Maybe a single stringpack for all the objects would be a good idea?

 - Add a new flag OBJ_BACKGROUND so an object is put in zplane 0 and this is not updated un UpdateZPlane. Now it is 
being skipped if current zplane is 0, but an actor could end up in zplane 0 if coming from a room with no (or incorrect)
walkbox data.

- Add scChangeName to change the name of an object, so Avon, Vila, Jenna, etc. do not show their names until
properly introduced.

Ideas and thoughts:
====================

- Guide at the begining.
- Pic with Jenna and his hand in the Liberator, when it reads her mind.
	
- Animation for Blake waiting???

- If a response to an action is not in the object code do not walk to object and fall to script 1

- Possibility of changing the default verb?

- Now we cannot get the coffee before talking to the technician, so that part could be removed from the scripts. 
Something similar happens with other responses to actions and look at verbs, which cannot be performed. The technician
cannot be looked at, for instance, or acted upon in any way.

- Add a walkbox where the guard stands in the hallway and set it as walkable/nonwalkable depending on whether he is
there or not?

- Implement frozen scripts as bit 7 set/unset, so they keep their old status after defreezing. This 
may cause problems with scripts in delay or waiting for events (which may have happened), and also
timers and events should operate only with the 6 lower bits.

- In the Editor, when a WB is set as non walkable, a $80 entry is set in the matrix. Don't think that is the
best idea... simply setting bit 7 would be enough (n | $80) or even nothing at all.
Also by default wb zplane is 0, which is not a good idea as it is copied to the character.

- Ways to test individual bits in the event mask. Maybe (an sfBit(byte, bitno)?)

- Change sfGetDistance to work between 2 points?

- Sector1 file includes a way to clear hires which is faster than mine. Check because it sets zeros from 9900 to c000
and I set $40, which seems to be needed or glitches appear.

- Managing user interaction with yet another script or 
hardcoded? The first could be easy to do: two vars with 
mouse coordinates and an event for click, or maybe two 
vars with coordinates where mouse was clicked last...

- Walk boxes and walk matrices. An easy way to get to a 
conected walk box is chosing a destination Row & Col:
	- if actor.row<box.top -> dest.row=box.top
	- if actor.row>box.bottom-> dest.row=box.bottom	
	- if actor.col<box.left -> dest.col=box.left
	- if actor.col>box.right -> dest.col=box.right
But this may take a wrong path to destination, outside the bounds
of the origin walk box. Probably a further check should determine if 
we should first match col or row to avoid that when walking.

BEWARE: ROWS are numbered from 0 (top) to 16(bottom) so comparisons
are the other way round!

- Check AdjustXYToBeInBox en actor.cpp to do something similar. It is much easier.
- More box flags: player-only and invalid?

DONE: saving at the begining of new episodes.
DONE: Using shortcuts to verbs used in sequence does not work (copies SelCurrentObjX which is $ff)
DONE: Move contents of _main and GenerateTables to the resource buffer, load the code there,
run and get back. That frees about 130 bytes. Each additional resource in disk, takes
several bytes in the disk tables (sector, size,...) which eat up the high memory!
DONE: We DO NEED a scEmptyInventory command!!!
DONE: Shortcuts to actions?
DONE: Redefine keys
DONE: Check zp vars are defined prior to use them. irq_detected, for instance, is in keyboard.s not in data.s, so
it could be being accessed as absolute.
DONE: Volume setup
DONE: Speaking speed = slow, normal, fast
DONE: - Avoid ESC working on cutscenes when there is no override: Create scBeginCutscene/scEndCutscene
so the override is erased when ending. Also ESC won't pause the game if in cutscene, even if no override
is set. Maybe setting override to 0 would do the trick now that backwards jumping is avoided?
Add ClearOverrideJump because ESC after the offset may go back, creating a problem.
Solved by checking if jumping was backwards and avoiding it 
DONE: Inventory was not being cleaned. Check if I did it correctly.
DONE: Check savepoints, I think there was one missing...
DONE: - Save game:
	- Only with no current action being executed or not in the middle of anything
	- Object data except pointers to graphics, animstates, etc.
	- Thread data, except pointers to base script data
	- Local and global variables.
	- Current room, current, ego... etc.
	- List of current USED GLOBAL resources: TYPE/ID

DONE: - On Load:
	- Load all the resources in list. The last one being the room. LoadRoom will
	load it, and CompactMemory will update all the pointers above. The loading of
	costume resources for global object in LoadRoom will do the rest.
	- LoadRoom here, however, should not run old room exit script nor new room entry
	script, I guess...

DONE: Switch to new version of floppybuilder
DONE: - SFX
DONE: Cursor leaves traces when Clearing inventory and command areas. It should be hidden if shown and ONLY shown back if
it was before....
DONE: Finish inventory with scrolling functionality
DONE: (completely?) Cleanup text.s
DONE: Problem in camera control room as it is not possible to stop the current command for a character. IDEA: 
put a new script command (scStopCharacter) which will call the code in verbexec.s which is now at the beginning of
ExecCommand creating a new function for stopping the actions.
DONE: New font (in low memory)
DONE: To implement promtply:  Exit script running, 
DONE: Add support for control codes for attributes in strings inside stringpacks in the compiler
DONE: Move tables to low memory and load them from disk
DONE: (I think) - No Costume is being nuked when no more in use...
DONE: Reference counter implemented
How to manage shared resources (sfx or costumes)? Need a reference count. E.g. a list with r-type|r-id|ref-count finished 
in $ff to keep track of them. Routines for loading and nuking may check the list in case a resource is shared.
DONE: (Hopefully) by using a $fe value.
My hack for meaning "any column" for walking to objects is not working because if fails in ContinuousExecCommand
where it is interpreted as meaning "near the object's column", where it means less than 3 tiles away. Not enough for
the hallway width.
DONE: 15 max objects is not enough. To add more, getObjNameEntry has to be tweaked but it is easy.
DONE: How to load objects from scripts to instantiate them? Add a scLoadObject? How to nuke them?
DONE (partially, simple solution seems to work fine enough) 
Music resource playing while compacting hangs. Need to detect this is happening in the compaction
loop, then wait for an irq (so the next note plays), then sei, move, update pointers and cli again.
But this needs to check if resource type is music, if the ID is the same as the one playing and create
code to update pointers (which could be tricky).
DONE (not fully checked) Local vars in scripts
DONE (apparently) - There was a problem in box.s with getWalkCoordinates not returning the carry correctly so 
a scWaitForActor command did not stop if Actor could not reach position.
Not sure if I solved it without breaking anything else...
DONE: It could be interesting to have an option to lock a resource so it cannot be nuked. The idea could be using bit 6
which would leave 6 bits for the resource type - 64 different types - Two script functions Lock and Unlock could 
set/clear the bit and NukeResource could check if it is set to avoid clearing bit 7.
DONE: There is a var with the number of chars printed. TimedTalk depending on string length
DONE: Not anymore :) And I think the same happens with string resources (never being nuked)
DONE: When an action is set off to run, the command line should be cleared
DONE (PARTIALLY - all loaded from rooms) Now that costume resource loading works, add costume to object resources and load it when adding an 
object to the game in object.s LoadObjectToGame Mailbox object is the only one currently, but actors
should be added as resources and tested.
DONE: Any code may start or stop a new script (attaching it to a thread) at any time, as code to run
 in parallel or immediately giving control to that thread until it ends, when control resumes to 
 the parent
DONE: Add script command to set camera column. Beware we use first_col which is the first visible column
and not the column the camera is at. How to handle this????
DONE There are not true/false constants in the script (maybe sfTrue and sfFalse?) - constants 0 and 1 do the trick
DONE: Check when to wake up parent threads. Now it is only done in scStopScript, which does not
ensure it is done if the script is killed by any other method.
DONE: BEWARE: We are using the entry # in the objects array 
for actors, instead of global IDs. This SHOULD be 
changed ASAP, because entry # are internal to the
engine, not the scripts.
DONE: Jenna stopped talking (visually) because the scripts are using position in arrays and not object IDs
DONE: Touble with resources when data is page-aligned 
such as in tiles in rooms or costumes. Either align 
data when loading, or start every resource on a page 
boundary (or tree bytes before) or just waste some
cycles on calculations.
DONE: object code (and properties?) should be on separate resources. Object code resources will have ID=objectID (not index)
and run as childs of currently executing thread. Not sure if this will work. Maybe we need to add another field with resource
type, to update pointers after compacting memory.
DONE: On engine start, script 0 is loaded and run. From
there a first room can be loaded.
DONE - Check how to manage the USE verb. It may mean:
	* USE an inventory object (turn on lamp, eat food)
	* USE an object in room (switch on lights or manage with ship controls)
	* USE an inventory object WITH another object in room (use rope with guard)
	* USE an inventory object WITH another inventory object (use battery with lantern?)
DONE - Inventory objects should include a flag to indicate if they should be used with another object. Originally
stored in the object data. When USING an object with the flag set, it will ask for a second object. The code script should
be found in the second object code if it exists so it should:
	- Check if the first one is in the inventory, else run action "PICK UP OBJECT"
	- Second check for the object in the inventory, if fails action fails, else it is run.
	- As with other actions if object (First if no second exists) is in inventory, there is no need
	to go near it.
This should work for all actions requiring two objects, such as GIVE TO. 	
DONE - Walk To should also peer into object's response script (walking to a door, for instance)
DONE - LoadResource should return pointer to data, *excluding* the ID field, as it does for strings. It is only used in scripts
to set the ID, but this is already known by the caller, which could set a parameter for this. This should be changed, affecting
the code which Runs a script in a thread and running object code (there is a ldy #1 which will become ldy #0)
DONE - Draw objects from bottom to top to support smaller objects.
DONE - Props can be objects with no tiles and one animatory state set to all 0's, but that should be something internal,
not to store in the resource.
DONE - Have a default action script (number 1?) for handling default (not programmed) interactions. May solve a lot of problems with
complex actions "USE obj WITH obj", when none is on the inventory, for instance?


BUGS:
=====

* Wrong walkboxes in teleport room.
* Command area is 9 pixels high, as verbs start at row 145. Two side effects: one line is not cleared
in ClearCommandArea (noticeable if you print text there with scPrintAt) and a possible verb with
a letter with pixels below the reference line, incorrectly shown.
* Saving does not work on Cumulus. * Hangs with yellow code when loading from end of EP1 to EP2 (loads Map and Coin, then hangs)
* 'If' offset wrongly calculated in swamp.os (Compiler)
* Description of coffee doesn't change when it is decaf.
* Graphic with weapon on pulley puts the weapon on the wrong side.
* Check disk access when playing SFX, as they are distorted
* Check if Blake Extras costume includes one unused
* Use may give inconsistent answers when you use A with B and only Use B is programmed, that answer is given.
* When the guards wakes up when you enter, he does not drink coffee, which is a bit confusing (it takes quite long
to realize he drinks the coffee from time to time to).
* for/while loops not working in object code (uses absolute offsets and does not take the response table space into consideration
 - change to labels)
* Need to defer actual LoadRoom outside the resource, so more things can be done in the script, such as setting
the camera, because many vars are reset during LoadRoom
* When actor is speaking, waits, and speaks again if sent on a walk, talk animation results in invalid animstates.
* Corner walkboxes are not handled correctly
* Animate characters should loop through the drawing queue?

DONE: No se graba al salir al exterior. Debería al menos al inicio del episodio 2
DONE: Still ugly overlap in Liberator passsage
DONE: When using a shortcut, objects are set to $ff and not updated if the shortcut is used again, forcing the user to move the mouse 
(even when the sentence is correct, as it was not updated)
DONE: Color of Travis speech when from the sec cam is red
DONE:  'DALE' Sólo se selcciona en 'DA'
DONE: Wrong strings for redefining keys
DONE: When in a local room (no hero here), clicking anywhere makes hero move wherever he is.
DONE: Blake appears bedind Avon when entering the Liberator Deck to kill the robot, even when he is in front.
DONE: Spanish text for locker room missing.
DONE: The infoman in the map room sometimes ends up facing front, resulting in wrong animation when talking.
DONE: (?) Accessing disk when trying to say a sentence which means load stringpack makes timer too short. 
Done by Resetting LastFrameTime.

DONE: Saving does not work in real hardware. Modified saving routines

DONE: [more or less] Timing of sentences when speaking is not constant. When the graphics are not updated it goes much quicker.

DONE: Loading a room with local scripts with ref count >1 fails when nuking those scripts (reference count for local resources not saved)
by simply ignoring if decrementing ref count goes below zero

DONE: Saving/loading with sfx sounding fails. Simply stop sounds.

DONE: Default WalkTo does not change to LookAt over inventory until space is pressed. But looks ugly now.

DONE: sometimes the cursor leaves traces over the sentence area

DONE: Some frames of the technician are missing (walking down).

DONE: Resource not found when loading strings for objects in inventory. Caused by memory leaks when not
nukin objectcode resources when action not in them (verbexec.s)

DONE: Hallway doors are not open if closing when walking into them... Maybe force a wait with isScriptRunning?

DONE: As objects put into inventory are removed from main array, many script functions (set/get state, RemoveObjFromGame,...) 
are failing!!!!

DONE: Cursor keeps redrawing when in a row near the menu area? 

DONE: Objects such as the sandwich and mug should be global

DONE: setting actor at col 0 was the culprit. Comming from infoarea to hallway and walking to the right side moves the camera, not the actor!!

DONE: Was a clc/sbc instead of sec/sbc. Silly me... Distance for interacting with objects is STILL WRONG!!!! It should depend on the location of the
object (left or right) to tweak the maximum difference.

DONE: _TalkingActor is not correctly reset as $ff sometimes (happened when trying to open the mailbox)

DONE: Loading a new room deactivates camera commands as expected, but also if it is following the actor, which is probably undesired if
it is the ego

DONE: Check a problem with cursor not being removed while scrolling if on the top left. Again a problem
in IsCursorInvalid

DONE: Camera-Follows-Actor is lost when loading new room

DONE:? Walkbox zplanes are not working yet. Needs additional code to select zplane mask

DONE:? More than one zplane creates bugs when masking...

DONE: Need to add a speaking queue or chracters skpeak over each other

DONE: Clicking when actor is doing something, should stop everything before being performed. Scripts keep on running. Scripts continue
but that can't be helped. However no nasty effects now.

DONE:  Rooms need 2 dummy columns to work. This is a waste and should be corrected: Making first_col as -2 and updating scroll routines

DONE: Avoid some actions over the current actor: Instead ego cannot be selected

DONE: Sometimes clicking seems to produce an ERR_NOTWALKBOX engine exception. This happens when actor is moving and currently outside 
a walkbox (how can this be?). Happened when an actor was moving from one wb to another. Removed the check in the code.

DONE: WALK TO <inventory object> walks to the bottom of the screen, instead of doing nothing...

DONE: GIVE BOX TO GIRL fails to walk to girl and look at her. GIVE KEY does work well, so it seems related to obj1 not in inventory.

DONE: If cursor moved while executing action, it fails: Should copy Object IDs (indexes) beforehand!!

DONE: Destination changes making the char change direction while moving may leave phantom traces. 
as the graphic is not correctly erased, depending on the animatory state
Solved Calling UpdateAnimstate before settind direction in LookDirection

DONE: LoadResource gets stuck searching if resource is not found.

DONE: Camera follows actor when starting movement at a border, even if to the opposite direction

DONE: Cursor is not correctly hidden when scrolling if it is too
high or low and in a corner (up left and down left/right apparently).
Maybe related whith test to see if cursor is inside room pic area? -
It was a wrong check in IsCursorInvalid

DONE: If special-casing mouse clicks outside walkboxes inside the getWalkCoordinates
as it is called from WalkTo and checks the final destination stored in vars before
adjusting, it never reaches the end position and freezes. It should be solved when 
clicking, before calling WalkTo

FOR SAVING GAME:
- Keep all data necessary together in data.s objects, inventory, thread space (including storage),... 
- Include the main global vars _CurrentEgo, etc.
- Set the current_ego_entry as soon as it has been loaded
- Load all objects in array back. Assign costumes.
- Load room resource and update pointers as when compressing memory (not running entry script)
- Load all scripts in threads. Reassign pointers.
- If music playing, do the same. Check about how to store current point in music.
- Check for other variables which are declared outside data.s
