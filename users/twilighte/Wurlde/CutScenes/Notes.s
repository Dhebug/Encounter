;Cut Scene Notes

Cut Scenes Planned

1) Riverboat Approach to Witches Castle (99% Done)
	Water laps at boat and is drawn left passed meadows and barns, old
	fences and deep forests towards the castle. The oars have no effect.
2) Witches castle (Not Done, few sketches)
	The boat reaches a jetty and Lucien is frozen to the spot by some
	unseen force. The scene then changes to a twilight side view through
	forest trees masking the black outline of 2 witches carrying a stretcher
	with Lucien on it, tied up. The drawbridge drops and they cross into the
	castle. Scene changes to interior of castle and the torture begins.
	
	One witch serves strange medicine to change luciens thoughts and body.
	One witch serves physical torture to find where he came from.
	One witch serves magic to discover his memory and laiden path in life.
	Take it from here AO but observe..
	
	Through the torture Lucien will learn some important things about wurlde.
	That a power struggle ensues between good and evil led by Birist, the beast
	spirit. His next in command Madrageth now strives to defeat Wurldes last
	two greatest sorcerers. One fled to an island and another has hidden.
	Madrageth sought them out by sending fire rain to the island and his
	wraithes to Wurlde mainland to uncover the other sorcerer.
	Madrageths heart is black, and can only be killed with the great sword.
	This is thought to be on Samson isle.
	
	Eventually Lucien escapes and manages to reach the drawbridge screen.
	Their he finds a strange Fire medallion on the ground, which he may now
	wear to keep the witches at bay. However they still chase him and are seen
	on their broomsticks silhouetting high behind the trees in the twilight.
	Lucien manages to reach the boat.
3) Riverboat departure from witches castle (Not Done)
	Lucien must now row to save his life (subgame) and finally arrives
	exhausted in Sassubree.
	One alternative here is the Weather Witch freezes the river crumpling the
	boat. Lucien must then take to the frozen river and leap over thin ice.
	However lucien will slide alot. Finally the witches will give up and lucien
	will find another boat to carry him to Sassubree.
4) Storm to Samson Isle (Not Done)
	After battling the great storm, Lucien is left on a tattered boat as it
	becomes washed up on Samson Isle. The cut-scene is shown as a birds-eye
	view of the boat as it seems to float over the heavens(stars) then the light
	changes and the water shallows to a thin film of water on sand, not
	dissimilar to the moon approach sequence in Baron Munchausen.

Sub Games Planned

1) Parralax Horse Ride to Homeland (Not Done)
	This is the way to get from Sassubree to Homeland and perhaps back again.
	Clouds, mountains, hills, trees and ground form multi-parralax smooth
	scrolling alt-line bg. In foreground could be masked fence, etc. if
	cpu permits.
	even lines for horse and rider with anims. However even this will require
	masking against backdrop. If a black horse is used then only the rider
	needs to be masked and bitmapped.
	As horse runs along, it can jump over rocks, under birds, pick up
	objects, etc. just like Wrath of a demon horse riding bit (yeah bit
	of a rip-off i guess). Ideas to make more unique AO?
2) Riding the storm to Samson Isle (Not Done)
	The boat departs sassubree harbour with Keggs the fisherman onboard.
	The Harbour - ()byte scroll left
	The Kobla Rose - (Mask against horizon)2 Pixel scroll left
	The horizon - ()1 Pixel scroll left
	The boat - (behind harbour, Masked against Horizon and Kobla Rose) 3 pixel scroll right.
	As Sassubree gradually fades onto the horizon a storm brews and the
	boat rides bigger and bigger waves. Keggs tries to control her but
	eventually he falls overboard leaving Lucien(you) to control the boat.
	The 'controls' are a red herring since the best way to control any boat
	through a storm is to keep low and do nothing. However the boats sail
	must be taken down.
	Similar scene to Myth on C64 Second or third level. Need boat design(AO)
3) Sky ride over the sea on a dragon (Not Done but promised help from Ptoing)
	The dragon is enticed with the toadstool and Lucien takes reigns as
	the pit dragon rises high into the air. Lucien must guide the dragon(black)
	through the storm, avoiding the lightning and thick cloud (hiding them
	completely) whilst encouraging the dragon to go higher with a regular
	up/down in rythm with flapping wings.
	Dragon may fly low enough to skim over sea (not sure yet), ideas AO?
4) Ascension up Ciro Mountain in a cage (80% Done)
	Lucien climbs inside cage and must lean left then right at gradually
	quickening pace in order to rotate the ratchet and climb the cable.
	If the speed is wrong, he will begin to descend. However pressing UP
	will hold the cage. Wraithes will attack the cage and must be knocked
	off by hitting them with the cage. Too many Wraithes will break the
	ratchet from the cable and the cage will plummet.
	Note this game features a diagonal smooth scroll of BG mountain side.
5) Riverboat escape from Banit Castle (Not Done) This may not be used
	Pressing Left/down/Right/up repeatedly in line with speed of oars to
	row faster or released to slow and move boat back.
	The witches may be seen flying on their broomsticks.
	Rain will fall turning to light fire rain that needs to be avoided.
6) Descension down Ciro Mountain (50% Done)
	Climbing in cage will release it down mountain gradually getting faster.
	So Lucien must hold up to keep speed down. If speed is too fast ratchet
	will overheat(white to red) and cage will plummet from cable.
7) Temples Great Horn Search (100% Done)
	Lucien needs the great horn to summon the pit dragon when he gets to
	Samson isle. It is rumoured to exist in Sassubree and on travelling
	passed the old sluece the old horn will be heard. Lucien must learn
	the keyword GREAT HORN then ask Temple(Swimmer) of it. Temple will
	then swim around where the hero is until the hero crouches, at which
	point Temple will dive. If Temple finds the horn he will exit right.
	Lucien can then buy the horn off Temple.


Quests Planned
1) Old Toms Windmill Grease (75% Done)
	On travelling to the windmill in the first game map Lucien will find
	old tom who will mention the Windmill is currently in much disrepair
	and would be renovated if he had some grease. On arriving at the pub
	Lief will be selling the Greasepot. Lucien may need to save up but
	once he gets the grease he can take it to old tom which will then
	trigger the windmill vanes not to be displayed.
	This in turn permits Lucien to pass the windmill screen and get more
	Bok fish and Fruit to sell on market.

	on Samson isle, Hayden stuff. Retnig will mention great horn which can
	be audibly heard over the sluece. The hero must travel to Fishy Plaice
	and ask Temple about Great Horn. This will prompt him to dive in and fetch
	it. However he won't just give you it, you must buy it from him.

	health. Shake tree for fruit to fall and eat and collect. Climb tree to
	find dagger. Move west to catch bok fish to eat and collect. West again
	to cross bog. Each step raises a stone which must be stood upon and will
	rise another stone. Lucien must step, jump and leap to get across.
	A briar pipe is on one stone but another holds gold which cannot be
	reached (red herring).
	West again is Windmill. Lucien must time his run left to avoid the vanes.
	West again is the old mill. Old Tom is in it but he is (for now) of little
	use. West again to butterflies where lucien can capture to take to market.

	He must fell the nearby tree to get across. He will need the axe which is
	hidden in the pile of logs aside the cabin.
	then on to the monastary where he must locate the sword and escape with
	his life. heading west he may restore his health at the cabin but if he
	stays overnight the monks will find and kill him.
	heading east again the tree will still be down. However on passing 5 times
	the tree will fall into the rivine.
	Passed the monastary Lucien will go down the hill.
	The monks will release timber logs which will roll down the hill and into
	a rivine at the bottom. Lucien must leap over the logs and leap over the
	rivine at just the right moment. Then through a dell to the dragons lair.
	He will need to have at least 1 toadstool. He will also need to sound
	the great Horn to summon the Dragon. The Toadstool will prevent the dragon

	The toadstools may be found in the Monastary dungeons.
Map04 Ciro Mountain - Ciro Castle, Littlepee, Cage, Dwarven mine entrance (MAP DONE!)
Map05 Other Scenes
	
	
	

Inside Maps
Map00 Hallowed 	- Pseudo 3D dungeon network opening part-way across river(bridge2) and ending
		  at Turn church. (Have 75% screens)
	The Pseudo 3D dungeon is represented by 2 sets of walls, floors and ceilings. Side
	entrances are through bitmap archways calculated at byte level. All graphics and code
	must fit in 16K.
Map01 Banit Castle	- Red Based Castle interiors (Map 90% Done)
	You are given a potion to kill spiders by Erth, however just one potion is posessed.
	on entering 'arches' you move right to 'cauldron' and a cauldron is lowered to the floor
	before Lucien has time to run across.
	A large spider clambers out. You may now use the potion to kill the spider and progress
	right to 'cauldron3'. Taking the wall lift then right to 'throne4', break the pot with
	the axe and it will release a key. Use key on sewer gate left on 'cauldron3' and it will
	also open gate on 'arches'. Entering sewer you will reappear at arches. Moving right to
	'cauldron' reveals floor switch or crank which controls descending cauldron and ideally
	pulls it up and breaks the cable, the pot then falls to the ground smashing it and
	destroying the spiders within allowing you to traverse this screen at ground level. Jumping
	from rampart to ground will kill lucien!
	cauldron3 should also have spikes that rise and fall from the floor.
	'Cauldron2' has a witch high on a ledge. She hits the ground with her stick and it prompts
	a sphere to bounce from the pot. The pot must be smashed with the axe to break the spell.

	him in the form of a Pit Dragon who he must slay with the great sword.
	It will now be revealed that his father was the great sorcerer that
	Madrageth seeked to kill with the fire rain, and somehow his heir has
	inherited all of his magical powers, This Madrageth realises too
	late as Jonny finally makes an appearance and as Madrageth tries to
	kill Jonny's spirit, Lucien must plunge his sword into Madrageths heart
	banishing him to the underwurlde forever.

Game Guide
Lucien begins in Ritemoor and must travel west to the River banit and board the boat.
He will then be transported to the Witches castle and interrogated but will escape
relatively unharmed and will collect the medallion and run the gauntlet in the boat
heading west to Sassubree. On arrival he will raise capital enough for passage to
Samson isle in Keggs boat. However Keggs is thrown overboard when a heavy storm rises
and Lucien is left to fend for himself. He manages to get to the island and travels
up the slope, falling the tree to traverse the rivine and into the monastery. There
he will locate the sword and escape east to the dragons pit/lair. The dragon will carry
the intrepid hero back to Sassubree. There he will learn about the fort and how it has
now taken many people into slavery. Lucien must then enter the fort.
He will then find the Spider killing potion and armour. On cracking the fort and returning
to sassubree, The steward will reward him with a horse who will carry him to homeland.
There he will find Erth who will give him quests to locate lost artifacts he will need.
Quest1(Bravery)  will have him remain in Homeland and locate hallow, venturing into the
	       shadows to find and bring back the Book of Wonder from the dungeons.
Quest2(Trust)    will have him remain in Homeland and head east to the cliff and step
	       over the brink to invisible steps to reach a floating island in the sky.
	       There he will find the Lantern spell and the wand.
Quest3(Sacrifice)will have him return to Ritemoor without the medallion to protect him, and
	       to collect the knife in the Fruit tree he met right at the start of the
	       game. He must also find a way passed the windmill vanes.
Quest4(Endurance)Erth will then tell him about combining the spell book with the wand to conjure
	       Magic and will send him off with Jiro to practice with it.
	       Using a memory game of words, he must recall up to 10 spells to conjure useful
	       actions before Jiro deems Lucien proficient.

Erth will then give him the final spell which will allow him to transport himself to any map
including Ciro Mountain. However the spell only transports him and not his posessions.
These he must sell to a market stall holder he knows travels to Ciro regularly.

On arrival at Ciro Lucien locates the market and buys his posessions back at double price.
Some posessions have been sold to Ciro Castle and he must steal them back.

He may then travel up the mountain to the mines.
Here he must use the spells he has learnt to defeat the warlocks, wraithes and Orcs guarding the
mine entrance. On killing them he may conjure a spell to take their life force from them in the
form of mana for himself.
He may then enter the mine, using another spell to provide him light. However as he moves down
the maze of tunnels, strange shadows will attack him. He must return to a lit place before using
his wand to dispell them. Finally he will arrive at the central cavern where he will meet
Madrageth in the form of a Dragon. The Dragon will breath fire and no amount of spells or weapons
can destroy him. As Lucien gets close to death himself Jonny makes an appearance taking Madrageths
attention away from him. Lucien must then use this opportunity to plunge the great sword into
Madrageth who will be banished forever. End of Game.

Spells are performed through learnt elven word sequences. Whilst the player is not expected to
remember the exact elven word, he must learn the correct sequence.
The Elvish language used is taken from Tolkien.
An extension of the language would be to teach the player to correctly identify the sequence
then expect them to correctly pronunciate each word by detecting delays in keyboard presses.
This means simply tapping the correct sequence is not sufficient, that they must put emphasis
on particular words (not neccesarily at the end or beginning of the sequence).
