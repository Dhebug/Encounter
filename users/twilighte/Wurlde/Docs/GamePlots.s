The general census is to get from A to B through a number of quests.

*** GAME PLOT FOR MAP02 (GAME START MAP) ***

The hero starts on the sea shore, having fallen into and been washed up by the sea.
He posesses nothing but the clothes on his back and his health is low. He has three pockets.

On the shore lyes an old fish hoop net. He should collect this.

Game1)
Nearby is an 'all fruit tree'. He must stagger across to it and after hitting the trunk
catch the fruit as they fall from it very fast.
This he can consume until some of his health is restored.
If the fruit falls to the ground, he may still eat or pick it up. However the fruit will always
be shown as rotten and eating this fruit after pocketing it will deplenish health !
With three pockets, he should stock up on one more pieces of fruit for the journey ahead.

He will then walk left through the corn field with the reflecting river infront.

Game2)
Here fish are in the spawning season and will jump out the river in an arc before diving
again. They move very fast and normally luck would only provide the hero a meal.
However as the fish are about to rise, the water bubbles and this may allow the hero more
time to get in position. As the fish is caught, the hero must press the Pickup key to pocket
it or the Action key to eat it otherwise the fish will wriggle out of his grasp.
AG: As a further angst to the hero, The white fish are safe to eat but black fish will reduce
    health.
The hero should pocket at least one fish and his health should be restored before progressing
to next screen on left.

Game3)
Here the land and river have merged into a thick mire. The bog will not only swallow up the hero
but the blood red areas will also scorch and burn, reducing his health.
Out amongst the old fence posts and occasional flowers are white stones that rise momentarily
out the mire.
The hero may use them as stepping stones to advance his passage.
He must observe the sequence that they rise and fall in order to progress to the next screen.
AG: However to further cause him angst some stones will not take his weight and will sink faster
    when stood upon.

Game4)
The windmill veins on the adjacent screen turn as the hero walks passed. He must avoid them
by running passed the windmill between the veins. If he is caught his health will severely
depleat.
He may enter the mill through its door and will find a straw bale he may collect. However on
exiting the veins will still turn and it may be more difficult to run out of their way.

On walk'on'right the veins will turn anticlockwise otherwise clockwise :)
AG: The veins will move faster

Game5)
The next screen is the old mill. Here an old man sits or walks back and forth with an old stick.
The hero should talk to the old man who will try to sell him a stick. The hero has no money
but may barter with the Fish and fruit he may posess already.

The old man also has Tobacco to sell.
Once the deal is struck he should posess at least some of the following items..

Fish
Fruit
Stick
Netting

He should then progress to the next screen where the butterflies nest..

Game6)
The butterflies are upset whenever animals move accross their territory and do bite but their
damage to the hero is negligable. The hero should Combine Net with Stick to get a Butterfly Net
and use it to capture some butterflies. These he can eat though they will not provide much
susternance.
They should be collected though.
He should now posess some of the following items..

Fish
Fruit
Butterfly Net
Butterflies

At any time, the hero may go back freely through the screens already visited, and may collect
and eat as much as he is able.

The next and final screen on Map02 is the Inner cliff. Here is moored a river boat aside the old
River banit which lyes behind the bank in the scene.
No one is here apart from hero. He may board the boat at which point he will sit and it will
silkerly scroll off-left behind the red rock cliff.

The first cut scene then begins...
=== Banit Witches ===
The boat is taken down stream, It has no oars so he must let it flow where it must.
the hero needing to do nothing more than lay an idle finger into the slipstream leaving a
glistening trail of silk reflection in its wake.
But a storm brews on the horizon and soon the rain falls. Rain turns to snow and then to hail..
The hero can only observe. His actions do nothing.
The boat lingers on, and moving into view is a jetty leading up to an old castle. The hail ceases
and the boat comes to a standstill at the jetty.
The screen blacks out, scene changes to show the inert figure of the hero being carried aloft
by some strange magic stretcher towards the castle trailed and led by witches with pointed hats
and large brooms being used as walking sticks.
All shown as black silhouettes infront of a moonlit night (or like Sonix demo).
Cut then to Banit witches bit which must mention the Blue rock which will avoid them.
The outcome is the hero leaves relatively unscathed physically and posessing the oars over his
shoulder. If he does not posess the oars he will not be able to escape in just the boat (it will
remain by the jetty).

He still has all his posessions from before he was captured.
His health may be low and may take some fish or fruit to replenish it.

Game5)
The hero must learn to use the oars to efficiently row beyond the grasp of the Witches wrath.

The scenery changes with a slow parralax effect as the boat picks up speed. A water effect
should also be provided. Whilst the game aspect(sideways scroller) does not permit the view
of both oars, the hero must left/right move in time with the rowing action and a little ahead
to increase pace.
The Witches use the weather against the hero, and a varied storm will insue which will attempt
to slow the heroes boat and ultimately reverse its course.
AG: Lava falls from the sky and must be avoided by moving the boat back/forth. If the boat is hit
    the hero will lose a lot of health. On impact in the water, the lava will steam and noise

If the boat reverses course too much, then the boat will begin to sink and the heroes health
will diminish. Eventually the hero will die.

After a time the weather will abait and the hero will arrive at Sasubree Castle on Map01.

The boat will remain at Sasubree Castle and may be used again to return to Map02.

Posession of the Blue Rock will avoid meeting the witches again and the boat will drift away
from sasubree castle and immediately drift onto Map02 Inner cliff.

During the Banit witches cut scene the Blue rock should be mentioned in the rhymes to alert the
hero. The artifacts stall in Sasubree Market should sell this item.


*** GAME PLOT FOR MAP01 (Sasubree) ***
Sasubree does not contain any games like Map02. Sasubree is a resource centre for information
and quests, for lodging(saving game) and departure by Land, River and Sea.

Land is by Sassubree Fort (once the Fort has been cracked) on horseback to Map00 and Wizards house
River is by Sassubree Fort to get to Map02 and the Windmill
Sea is by Sassubree harbour to get to Map03 and Samson Isle

The hero starts on the left outside Sasubree Castle. The red castle may be entered later in game.
The Hero should proceed to the next screen to the right.

This is the old bakery. The hero may purchase bread but cannot barter here.
He should press up to enter the bakery. Their he will meet Derb and Kinda.
The next screen has the Pirates Inn and Stocks. He may enter the Inn to gain lodging and save the
game. He may also buy alcohol, supplies or just talk to the Innkeeper or residents to get
stories, myths, rumours and information.

Items can be lent to other characters. Depending on character the item may be bought back for
0 to a small number of grotes. However some disreputable characters may hide or even sell on
the items you lend them, so a shrewd judge of character is required.

In this way he will be able to stock up on many more posessions than he can carry on his own.

Talking to residents or the Innkeeper requires that he drink lots of beer and pay for theirs too.
No credit is given.

If he consumes too much alcohol he will be placed in the stocks outside, his mana will be removed
and his health seriously depleated. He will also lose all his posessions and half his money.
The Innkeaper and residents will pass posessions to Sasubree Market.
Any posessions held by the Innkeeper on his behalf will still be held though.

The next screen is Sasubree Market, split into Green(Fruit&Veg), Cyan(Artifacts), Purple(Herbs and
Spices), Yellow(Bread, Dairy, Meat and other food produce) and Blue(Fish) areas.
Both the fish and the Fruit from Map02 is in great demand here.
If the hero posesses Fish he should take it to the Blue area and barter it for money.
If the hero posesses Fruit he should take it to the Green area and barter it for money.
The Butterflies are also extremely valuable and may be sold to the Purple stalls.
On any given day their may be more than one stall selling the same produce. The hero must look
to sell his posessions for the best price.
Also some days only some Stalls may be present as the merchants travel all over Wurlde.
The hero may also buy items from the Market and may also bargain for the best price.

The hero should now posess some money which he should use to stay at one of the two Inns in
Sasubree (in order to save the game) and to gain some health.
Sasubree harbour on the screen to the right of the Market holds The Kissing Wench Tavern which
is a great place for rumours and old wives tales.
It is also the only place to charter Sea boats from, in order to gain passage to the distant
islands.

To the right of Sasubree Harbour is the long jetty where boats are moored and where (first
thing in the morning) is the best place to find fresh cheap fish which may be bartered for money
on the market later in the day. In fact in this way it is possible to make a profit.
The mechanism for buying and selling fish works on the basis that the price of fish will increase
as the day wears on until nightfall when the price will be at the highest.
However if the hero holds on to the fish for too long, they will go off (rotten) and he will not
be able to sell them, he will only be able to drop them. Dropping fish (or any consumable) in a
public place is an offence and instantly punishable with a session in the stocks.

The Hero should at least have discovered the old Leather Satchel which will increase his pouches
from three to ten pockets and have the following posessions..

Blue Rock - To protect him from Banit Witches.

He should also have picked up some rumours and stories, both from the Inns and the Banit Witches
and should have some Grotes (money) now.
He should also have at least some artifacts and stocked up on some food from the market.
He is ready for his first quest!
